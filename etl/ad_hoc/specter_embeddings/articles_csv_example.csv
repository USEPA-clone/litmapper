0,287928,29109240,Deficiency of the Thyroid Hormone Transporter Monocarboxylate Transporter 8 in Neural Progenitors Impairs Cellular Processes Crucial for Early Corticogenesis.,"Thyroid hormones (THs) are essential for establishing layered brain structures, a process called corticogenesis, by acting on transcriptional activity of numerous genes. In humans, deficiency of the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), involved in cellular uptake of THs before their action, results in severe neurological abnormalities, known as the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome. While the brain lesions predominantly originate prenatally, it remains unclear how and when exactly MCT8 dysfunction affects cellular processes crucial for corticogenesis. We investigated this by inducing "
1,287929,29099056,Ammonia Reduces Intracellular Asymmetric Dimethylarginine in Cultured Astrocytes Stimulating Its y⁺LAT2 Carrier-Mediated Loss.,"Previously we had shown that ammonia stimulates nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in astrocytes by increasing the uptake of the precursor amino acid, arginine via the heteromeric arginine/glutamine transporter y⁺LAT2. Ammonia also increases the concentration in the brain of the endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthases (NOS), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), but distribution of ADMA surplus between the intraastrocytic and extracellular compartments of the brain has not been studied. Here we tested the hypothesis that ammonia modulates the distribution of ADMA and its analog symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) between the two compartments of the brain by competition with arginine for the y⁺LAT2 transporter. In extension of the hypothesis we analyzed the ADMA/Arg interaction in endothelial cells forming the blood-brain barrier. We measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS) technique the concentration of arginine, ADMA and SDMA in cultured cortical astrocytes and in a rat brain endothelial cell line (RBE-4) treated with ammonia and the effect of silencing the expression of a gene coding y⁺LAT2. We also tested the expression of ADMA metabolism enzymes: protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) and dimethylarginine dimethyl aminohydrolase (DDAH) and arginine uptake to astrocytes. Treatment for 48 h with 5 mM ammonia led to an almost 50% reduction of ADMA and SDMA concentration in both cell types, and the effect in astrocytes was substantially attenuated by silencing of the "
2,287930,29076908,AIDS-Related Central Nervous System Toxoplasmosis With Increased 18F-Fluoroethyl-L-Tyrosine Amino Acid PET Uptake Due to LAT1/2 Expression of Inflammatory Cells.,"We report the case of a 40-year-old woman with a progressive right-sided hemiparesis. Standard MRI revealed a contrast-enhancing brain lesion within the left basal ganglia. Ffluoroethyl-L-tyrosine (F-FET) PET showed a distinct tracer uptake (lesion-to-brain ratio [LBR]: LBRmax = 2.03, LBRmean = 1.68) with a significant larger metabolic lesion volume than contrast-enhancement in MRI, indicating cerebral glioma. Surprisingly, histopathologic analysis demonstrated central nervous system toxoplasmosis with pronounced inflammatory reaction (reactive astrogliosis, microglia activation, macrophage, and T-lymphocyte infiltration), which was associated with strong LAT1/LAT2/CD98 expression. In conclusion, inflammatory brain lesions, such as cerebral toxoplasmosis, represent a potential pitfall of F-FET PET mimicking a brain tumor."
3,287931,29050191,[The ocular involvement in the transthyretin-related familial amyloid polyneuropathy].,"Transthyretin (TTR)-related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), which is caused by mutant TTR, is a rare but fatal autosomal dominant disease. TTR is synthesized by the liver (95%) , the choroid plexus of the brain and the retinal pigment epithelium. FAP leads to peripheral neuropathy, and the main ocular manifestations are vitreous opacity (yellowish cotton-like), secondary glaucoma and keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Liver transplantation has proven to be the most effective treatment for TTR-FAP. Nowadays, tafamidis is the only drug approved for TTR-FAP (early stage). However, neither liver transplantation nor tafamidis is capable to halt the progression of ocular involvement. Panretinal photocoagulation could damage the retinal pigment epithelium, and thus prevent the progression. Recent investigations on TTR-FAP and its ocular involvement are reviewed in this article. 转甲状腺素蛋白（TTR）相关的家族性淀粉样多神经病变是一种由TTR基因变异引起的严重危害生命的常染色体显性遗传病，临床较为罕见。TTR主要由肝脏产生，小部分由脑部的脉络丛及眼部的视网膜色素上皮细胞产生。病变主要累及周围神经系统，眼部受累最显著的表现为黄白色棉绒样团块状或片状玻璃体混浊，常合并继发性青光眼、干眼。肝移植手术是目前最有效的治疗方法，口服药物Tafamidis可用于疾病的早期治疗。但肝移植手术及药物无法治疗眼部病变，全视网膜激光光凝是通过破坏视网膜色素上皮细胞而控制眼部病变的发展。本文总结近年有关家族性淀粉样多神经病变及其眼部诊疗的研究和资料，以供临床参考。"

5,287937,28957343,"A prospective, observational study of patients with uncommon distal symmetric painful small-fiber neuropathy.","To investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with uncommon distal symmetric painful small-fiber neuropathy (DSPSFN).From September 2012 to September 2014, participants between 18-70 years of age that had DSPSFN defined by clinical signs/symptoms and ID pain > 2 or DN4 > 4 on questionnaires for more than 1 month were included. Participants who had previous historical or laboratory evidence of common etiologies of DSPSFN were excluded. Enzyme activity and genetic studies for Fabry diseaseand familial amyloid polyneuropathy were performed after participants fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The cryoglobulin test, autoantibodies studies and electrophysiological studies were performed in these participants.In total, 100 cases were enrolled in the current study. Three cases of subclinical diabetes mellitus and two cases of fibromyalgia were found. Fabry disease (1%) and familial amyloid polyneuropathy (3%) with Ala97Ser transthyretin (TTR) mutations were also detected. The cryoglobulin test was positive in 30% of participants, and these participants had higher DN4 scores than the negative group. In the autoantibodies studies, 59% of the participants had abnormal anti-Ro/SSA and/or anti-La/SSB antibodies.Cryoglobulinemia is not a rare etiology of uncommon DSPSFN. The long-term prognosis is quite good in these participants. From our structuralized protocol, Fabry disease and familial amyloid polyneuropathy could be easily detected in these cases of uncommon DSPSFN."

8,287933,29023516,Hypothalamic control systems show differential gene expression during spontaneous daily torpor and fasting-induced torpor in the Djungarian hamster (Phodopus sungorus).,"Djungarian hamsters are able to use spontaneous daily torpor (SDT) during the winter season as well as fasting-induced torpor (FIT) at any time of the year to cope with energetically challenging environmental conditions. Torpor is a state of severely reduced metabolism with a pronounced decrease in body temperature, which enables animals to decrease their individual energy requirements. Despite sharing common characteristics, such as reduced body mass before first torpor expression and depressed metabolism and body temperature during the torpid state, FIT and SDT differ in several physiological properties including torpor bout duration, minimal body temperature, fuel utilization and circadian organization. It remains unclear, whether SDT and FIT reflect the same phenomenon or two different physiological states. The hypothalamus has been suggested to play a key role in regulating energy balance and torpor. To uncover differences in molecular control mechanisms of torpor expression, we set out to investigate hypothalamic gene expression profiles of genes related to orexigenic (Agrp/Npy), circadian clock (Bmal1/Per1) and thyroid hormone (Dio2/Mct8) systems of animals undergoing SDT and FIT during different torpor stages. Orexigenic genes were mainly regulated during FIT and remained largely unaffected by SDT. Expression patterns of clock genes showed disturbed circadian clock rhythmicity in animals undergoing FIT, but not in animals undergoing SDT. During both, SDT and FIT, decreased Dio2 expression was detected, indicating reduced hypothalamic T3 availability in both types of torpor. Taken together, our results provide evidence that SDT and FIT also differ in certain central control mechanisms and support the observation that animals undergoing SDT are in energetical balance, whereas animals undergoing FIT display a negative energy balance. This should be carefully taken into account when interpreting data in torpor research, especially from animal models of fasting-induced hypometabolism such as mice."
9,287934,29019809,Atrial Fibrillation and Central Nervous Complications in Liver Transplanted Hereditary Transthyretin Amyloidosis Patients.,"Central nervous system (CNS) complications are increasingly noted in liver transplanted (LTx) hereditary transthyretin amyloid (ATTRm) amyloidosis patients; this suggests that the increased survival allows for intracranial ATTRm formation from brain synthesized mutant TTR. However, atrial fibrillation (AF), a recognised risk factor for ischemic CNS complications, is also observed after LTx. The aim of the study was to investigate the occurrence of CNS complications and AF in LTx ATTRm amyloidosis patients.The medical records of all LTx ATTRm amyloidosis patients in the county of Västerbotten, Sweden, were investigated for information on CNS complications, AF, anticoagulation (AC) therapy, hypertension, cardiac ischemic disease, hypertrophy, and neurological status.Sixty-three patients that had survived for 3 years or longer after LTx were included in the analysis. Twenty-five patients had developed 1 or more CNS complications at a median of 21 years after onset of disease. AF was noted in 21 patients (median time to diagnosis 24 years). Cerebrovascular events (CVE) developed in 17 (median time to event 21 years). CVEs occurred significantly more often in patients with AF (P < 0.002). AC therapy significantly reduced CVEs, including bleeding in patients with AF (P = 0.04). Multivariate analysis identified AF as the only remaining regressor with a significant impact on CVE (hazard ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval 1.1-9.5; P = 0.029).AF is an important risk factor for CVE in LTx ATTRm amyloidosis patients, and AC therapy should be considered. However, the increased bleeding risk with AC therapy in patients with intracranial amyloidosis should be acknowledged."
10,287935,28960480,Evidence that glial cells attenuate G47R transthyretin accumulation in the central nervous system.,"Amyloidogenic protein forms amyloid aggregations at membranes leading to dysfunction of amyloid clearance and amyloidosis. Glial cells function in the clearance and degradation of amyloid β (Aβ) in the brain. This study aimed to clarify the reason why amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) rarely accumulates in the CNS. We pathologically analyzed the relationship between amyloid deposition with basement membranes or glial cells in a rare case of ATTR leptomeningeal amyloidosis. In addition, we compared the cytotoxicity of ATTR G47R, the amyloidosis-causing mutation in the case studied (n = 1), and Aβ in brains from patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (n = 6). In the subarachnoid space of the ATTR G47R case, most amyloids accumulated at the components of basement membranes. On the CNS surface, ATTR accumulations were retained by astrocytic end feet. In areas where glial end feet enveloped ATTR, ubiquitination and micro-vacuolation of ATTR was evident. The colocalization of GFAP and ubiquitin was also evident. The accumulation of ATTR G47R in the CNS was negatively correlated with the prevalence of astrocytes. Quantitatively, amyloid deposits along the vessels were mostly partial in cerebral Aβ angiopathy cases and nearly complete along the basement membrane in the ATTR G47R case. The vascular expressions of type IV collagen and smooth muscle actin were severely reduced in areas with ATTR G47R deposition, but not in areas with Aβ deposition. The vascular protein level recovered in the ATTR G47R case when vessels entered into areas of parenchyma that were rich in astrocytes. In addition, the strong interactions between the transthyretin variant and basement membranes may have led to dysfunction of transthyretin clearance and leptomeningeal amyloidosis. The present study was the first to show that glial cells may attenuate G47R transthyretin accumulation in the CNS."

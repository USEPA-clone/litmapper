The present study was carried out to examine the mercurial effects on the iodination, the second step of TPO. Purified porcine thyroglobulin or bovine serum albumin as acceptor protein was iodinated with [125I]NaI and H2O2 by purified porcine TPO. Iodinated protein was separated by acid precipitation on membrane filter or paper chromatography. Both CH3HgCl and HgCl2 dose-dependently inhibited the iodination, but HgCl2 was more potent to inhibit the iodination than CH3HgCl. These mercurial effects on the second step resemble the effects on the third step which were already reported; but are in marked contrast to the effects on the first step, where TPO was inhibited by HgCl2 but never by CH3HgCl.",2090100,wklaren@21centurytoxicology.com,,1,,In_Vitro,,,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,"CH3HgClHgCl2",,,Other_Mammal,porcine | bovine,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TPO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,"[JU review: added ""bovine"" to ""Other mammal"" text box (Q4).]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TPO_activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_activity_method,protein iodination,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_models_used,protein-based assay,,,"As the activity was tested in a non-cell based system nor were tissues described, the mechanics/source of the assay were captured under question 16.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

W.",PBPK predictions of perchlorate distribution and its effect on thyroid uptake of radioiodide in the male rat,"Due to perchlorate's (ClO4-) ability to competitively inhibit thyroid iodide (I-) uptake through the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS), potential human health risks exist from chronic exposure via drinking water. Such risks may include hypothyroidism, goiter, and mental retardation (if exposure occurs during critical periods in neurodevelopment). To aid in predicting perchlorate's effect on normal I- kinetics, we developed a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for the adult male rat. The model structure describes simultaneous kinetics for both anions together with their interaction at the NIS, in particular, the inhibition of I- uptake by ClO4-. Subcompartments and Michaelis-Menten (M-M) kinetics were used to describe active uptake of both anions in the thyroid, stomach, and skin. Separate compartments for kidney, liver, plasma, and fat were described by passive diffusion. The model successfully predicts both 36ClO4- and 125I- kinetics after iv doses of 3.3 mg/kg and 33 mg/kg, respectively, as well as inhibition of thyroid 125I- uptake by ClO4- after iv doses of ClO4- (0.01 to 3.0 mg/kg). The model also predicts serum and thyroid ClO4- concentrations from 14-day drinking water exposures (0.01 to 30.0 mg ClO4-/kg/day) and compensation of perchlorate-induced inhibition of radioiodide uptake due to upregulation of the thyroid. The model can be used to extrapolate dose metrics and correlate observed effects in perchlorate toxicity studies to other species and life stages, such as rat gestation (Clewell et al., 2003). Because the model successfully predicts perchlorate's interaction with iodide, it provides a sound basis for future incorporation of the complex hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid feedback system.",12700397,wklaren@21centurytoxicology.com,,1,,,,,,,Comp_inSilico_Modeling_MetaAnal,,,,Yes_Chemical,"perchlorate (ClO4-)iodide (I-)",Rodent,,,,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,Chemical_ADME_PBPK,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,"[JU review: 1. added I- to chem list (Q2). 2. selected Chem PBPK to Q10.

M.",Predicting neonatal perchlorate dose and inhibition of iodide uptake in the rat during lactation using physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling,"Perchlorate (ClO4-), a contaminant in drinking water, competitively inhibits active uptake of iodide (I-) into various tissues, including mammary tissue. During postnatal development, inhibition of I- uptake in the mammary gland and neonatal thyroid and the active concentration ClO4- in milk indicate a potentially increased susceptibility of neonates to endocrine disruption. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to reproduce measured ClO4- distribution in the lactating and neonatal rat and predict resulting effects on I- kinetics from competitive inhibition at the sodium iodide symporter (NIS). Kinetic I- and ClO4- behavior in tissues with NIS (thyroid, stomach, mammary gland, and skin) was simulated with multiple subcompartments, Michaelis-Menten (M-M) kinetics and competitive inhibition. Physiological and kinetic parameters were obtained from literature and experiment. Systemic clearance and M-M parameters were estimated by fitting simulations to tissue and serum data. The model successfully describes maternal and neonatal thyroid, stomach, skin, and plasma, as well as maternal mammary gland and milk data after ClO4- exposure (from 0.01 to 10 mg/kg-day ClO4-) and acute radioiodide (2.1 to 33,000 ng/kg I-) dosing. The model also predicts I- uptake inhibition in the maternal thyroid, mammary gland, and milk. Model simulations predict a significant transfer of ClO4- through milk after maternal exposure; approximately 50% to 6% of the daily maternal dose at doses ranging from 0.01 to 10.0 mg ClO4-/kg-day, respectively. Comparison of predicted dosimetrics across life-stages in the rat indicates that neonatal thyroid I- uptake inhibition is similar to the adult and approximately tenfold less than the fetus.",12805655,wklaren@21centurytoxicology.com,,1,,,,,,,Comp_inSilico_Modeling_MetaAnal,,,,Yes_Chemical,"Perchlorate (ClO4-)iodide (I-)",Rodent,,,,,,,,,,,Yes_LifeStage,,,,,Neonatal,,,Fetus,,,Lactating,,,Adult,,,,,,,,,,,,,NIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,Chemical_ADME_PBPK,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,"[JU review: 1. added I- to chem list (Q2). 2. selected Chem PBPK to Q10.

E., Van Sande, J., De Deken, X.",Association of duoxes with thyroid peroxidase and its regulation in thyrocytes,"CONTEXT: Thyroid hormone synthesis requires H(2)O(2) produced by dual oxidases (Duoxes) and thyroperoxidase (TPO). Defects in this system lead to congenital hypothyroidism. H(2)O(2) damage to the thyrocytes may be a cause of cancer. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate whether Duox and TPO, the H(2)O(2) producer and consumer, might constitute a complex in the plasma membrane of human thyroid cells, thus maximizing efficiency and minimizing leakage and damage. DESIGN: The interaction between Duox and TPO was studied by coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting of plasma membranes from incubated follicles prepared from freshly resected human thyroid tissue from patients undergoing thyroidectomy, and COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the entire Duoxes or truncated [amino (NH2) or carboxyl (COOH) terminal]. RESULTS: The following results were reached: 1) Duox and TPO from membranes are coprecipitated, 2) this association is up-regulated through the Gq-phospholipase C-Ca(2+)-protein kinase C pathway and down-regulated through the Gs-cAMP-protein kinase A pathway, 3) H(2)O(2) increases the association of Duox1 and Duox2 to TPO in cells and in membranes, and 4) truncated NH(2)- or COOH-terminal Duox1 and Duox2 proteins show different binding abilities with TPO. CONCLUSION: Coimmunoprecipitations show that Duox and TPO locate closely in the plasma membranes of human thyrocytes, and this association can be modulated by H(2)O(2), optimizing working efficiency and minimizing H(2)O(2) spillage. This association could represent one part of a postulated pluriprotein complex involved in iodination. This suggests that defects in this association could impair thyroid hormone synthesis and lead to thyroid insufficiency and cell damage.",19952225,mheintz,,1,,In_Vitro,,,Clinical_Descriptive,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,H(2)O(2),,Human,Other_Mammal,monkey,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TPO,,,,DUOX,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,Yes_Crosstalk,Gq-phospholipase C-Ca(2+)-protein kinase C pathway | Gs-cAMP-protein kinase A pathway,Primary,,,,,,"(IL) Updated Chemical, MIE and cross-talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TPO_protein,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Protein_protein,interaction between Duox and TPO,,,Western,,,Other_protein_method,coimmunoprecipitation,Thyroid_protein,,,,,,,COS7_protein,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_models_used,Transient transfection with entire Duoxes or truncated [amino (NH2) or carboxyl (COOH) terminal].,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A.",Circulating thyroid hormone levels and iodothyronine deiodinase activities in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) following dietary exposure to Endosulfan and Aroclor 1254,"We evaluated the effects of two organochlorinated environmental contaminants, Endosulfan and Aroclor 1254 on peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism and thyroid hormone plasma levels in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Tilapia were exposed through diet to 0.1 and 0.5 gg g(-1) of Endosulfan and 0.5 mu g g(-1) of Aroclor 1254 for 21 and 35 days. Decreased plasma T4 and rT3 levels were observed in tilapia exposed to the lower dose of Endosulfan, while treatment with a higher dose and Aroclor 1254 produced no changes. Plasma rT3 levels were not affected by these compounds. Hepatic type I deiodinase (D1) activity was depressed by a lower dose of Endosulfan and hepatic type III (133) activity was increased following 35 days of exposure to the lower dose-of Endosulfan and following 21 and 35 days of exposure to Aroclor 1254; while type II (D2) remained unchanged in liver as well as in all other organs analysed. Apart from hepatic D3 activity, Endosulfan and Aroclor 1254 also increased D3 activity in gill, but not in other tested organs. It is concluded that dietary exposure of tilapia to Endosulfan or Aroclor 1254 can lead to changes in circulating thyroid hormone levels and/or in peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. The changes in hormone metabolism differ between tissues, eventually reflecting tissue-specific differences in adaptation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

625990,"Sharlin, D. S., Gilbert, M. E., Taylor, M. A., Ferguson, D. C., Zoeller, R. T.",The nature of the compensatory response to low thyroid hormone in the developing brain,"Thyroid hormone is essential for normal brain development, although the degree to which the developing brain is sensitive to small perturbations in serum thyroxin is not clear. An important concept related to this is that the developing brain possesses potent mechanisms to compensate for low serum thyroid hormone, and this concept is routinely employed in discussions concerning clinical treatments or public health. However, experimental studies have not directly tested whether (or the degree to which) putative compensatory mechanisms can ameliorate the consequences of small reductions in serum thyroxin (T(4)). To formally test this concept, we employed a model of graded T(4) reductions using doses of propylthiouracil (PTU) that were 200- to 67-fold lower than the dose traditionally used to produce hypothyroidism in rats. PTU produced a stepwise decrease in serum total T(4), and a stepwise increase in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), in type 2 deiodinase mRNA expression and enzyme activity in the brain, and in the expression of the mRNA encoding the tri-iodothyronine (T(3)) transporter MCT8 in the postnatal day (P) 15 cortex. However, the mRNA encoding RC3/neurogranin, a direct target of T(3) action, exhibited a strong negative linear correlation with serum total T(4) despite these adaptive responses. In addition, single-cell analysis of RC3 mRNA levels in cortical neurones demonstrated that the co-expression of MCT8 did not alter the relationship between RC3 mRNA and serum T(4). These findings do not support the currently envisioned concept of the developing brain being capable of compensating for low T(4).",20041985,jurban@toxstrategies.com,,1,,,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,propylthiouracil (PTU),Rodent,,,,,,,,,,,Yes_LifeStage,,,,Postnatal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mem_Transporters,DIO,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO2,,DIO_mRNA,,DIO_activity,,Expression,,,,,,,,,,,Brain_mRNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Brain_activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MCT8,,,,,,,,,,MT_mRNA,,,,Expression,,,,,,,,,,,Brain_mRNA,cortex,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,T4,TSH,,,,,,,,Brain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

W.",Low-dose effects of ammonium perchlorate on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis of adult male rats pretreated with PCB126,"The objective of this research was to characterize the disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis resulting from exposure to a binary mixture, 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126) and perchlorate (ClO(4)(-)), known to cause hypothyroidism by different modes of action. Two studies were conducted to determine the HPT axis effects of ClO(4)(-) on adult male Sprague-Dawley rats pretreated with PCB126. In dosing study I, rats were administered a single oral dose of PCB126 (0, 7.5, or 75 microg/kg) on day 0 and 9 days later ClO(4)(-) (0, 0.01, 0.1, or 1 mg/kg day) was added to the drinking water until euthanasia on day 22. Significant dose-dependent trends were found for all thyroid function indices measured following ClO(4)(-) in drinking water for 14 days. Seventy-five micrograms PCB126/kg resulted in a significant increase in hepatic T(4)-glucuronide formation, causing a decline in serum thyroxine and fT(4), and resulting in increased serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Serum TSH was also increased in animals that received 7.5 microg PCB126/kg; no other HPT axis alterations were found in these animals. When pretreated with PCB126, the ClO(4)(-) dose trends disappeared, suggesting a less than additive effect on the HPT axis. In dosing study II, animals were given lower doses of PCB126 (0, 0.075, 0.75, or 7.5 microg/kg) on day 0, and followed with ClO(4)(-) (0 or 0.01 mg/kg day) in drinking water beginning on day 1 and continuing for several days to explore transient HPT axis effects.

It is, therefore, a good model chemical to aid in the development of a bioassay to screen chemicals for affects on thyroid function. Xenopus laevis larvae were exposed to sodium perchlorate during metamorphosis, a period of TH-dependent development, in two experiments. In the first experiment, stage 51 and 54 larvae were exposed for 14 d to 16, 63, 250, 1,000, and 4,000 microg perchlorate/ L. In the second experiment, stage 51 larvae were exposed throughout metamorphosis to 8, 16, 32, 63, and 125 microg perchlorate/L. Metamorphic development and thyroid histology were the primary endpoints examined. Metamorphosis was retarded significantly in the first study at concentrations of 250 microg/L and higher, but histological effects were observed at 16 microg/L. In the second study, metamorphosis was delayed by 125 microg/L and thyroid size was increased significantly at 63 microg/L. These studies demonstrate that inhibition of metamorphosis readily can be detected using an abbreviated protocol. However, thyroid gland effects occur at concentrations below those required to elicit developmental delay, demonstrating the sensitivity of this endpoint and suggesting that thyroidal compensation is sufficient to promote normal development until perchlorate reaches critical concentrations.",15839568,mheintz,,1,,,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,sodium perchlorate,,,,,,Amphibian,,,,,,Yes_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Larva,Metamorphosis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,IL - changed Q11 to 'yes' as perchlorate is said to act through NIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TG_weight_size,TG_gross_histopath,,,,,,,,Amphibian_development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

D.",Interspecies differences in susceptibility to perturbation of thyroid homeostasis: a case study with perchlorate,"Despite many physiological similarities, humans and rats exhibit notably different susceptibilities to thyroid perturbation. Considerable research has recently been conducted on the thyroid-active chemical perchlorate, a chemical of emerging environmental and regulatory interest. While the data indicate humans and rats exhibit similar dose-response relationships in terms of acute inhibition of thyroidal iodide uptake, the two species appear to exhibit notable differences in terms of thyroid hormone response, the toxicologically significant consequence of iodide uptake inhibition. We analyzed dose-response data for changes in serum T(3), T(4), and TSH levels from studies in humans, rats, mice, and rabbits. We found that thyroid homeostasis in the rat appears to be strikingly more sensitive to perchlorate than any of the other species. Rats exhibited an increase in serum TSH at 0.1mg/kg-day whereas other species remained unresponsive even at doses of 10mg/kg-day. Less pronounced but consistent effects were seen with serum T(3) and T(4). These cross-species comparisons provide strong evidence that data obtained from rat studies should be critically evaluated for their relevance to humans. If rat data are used to develop toxicity criteria for perchlorate, we propose that this is an instance where an inter-species uncertainty factor less than one is supportable.

The present study examines the ability of PFOS to disturb thyroid function and the possible mechanisms involved in PFOS-induced thyroid hormone alteration. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 1.7, 5.0, and 15.0 mg/L of PFOS in drinking water for 91 consecutive days. Serum was collected for analysis of total and free thyroxine (T4), total triiodothyronine (T3), and thyrotrophin (TSH). Thyroid and liver were removed for the measurement of endpoints closely related to thyroid hormone biosynthesis and metabolism following PFOS exposure. Determined endpoints were the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels for two isoforms of uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferases (UGT1A6 and UGT1A1) and type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) in liver, sodium iodide symporter (NIS), TSH receptor (TSHR), and DIO1 in thyroid as well as the activity of thyroid peroxidase (TPO). Serum total T4 level decreased significantly at all applied dosages, whereas total T3 level increased markedly only at 1.7 mg/L of PFOS. No statistically significant toxic effects of PFOS on serum TSH were observed. Hepatic UGTIA1, but not UGT1A6, mRNA was up-regulated at 5.0 and 15.0 mg/L of PFOS. Treatment with PFOS lowered hepatic DIO1 mRNA at 15.0 mg/L but increased thyroidal DIO1 mRNA dose dependently. The activity of TPO, NIS, and TSHR mRNA in thyroid were unaffected by PFOS treatment. These results indicate that increased hepatic T4 glucuronidation via UGT1A1 and increased thyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 via DIO1 were responsible in part for PFOS-induced hypothyroxinemia in rats.",19045937,mheintz,,1,,,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS),Rodent,,,,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NIS,TPO,,,DIO,,,,,Sulfation_Glucuronidation,,,TSHR,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,,,NIS_mRNA,,,,,Expression,,,,,,,,,Thyroid_mRNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TPO_activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Thyroid_activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO1,,,DIO_mRNA,,,,Expression,,,,,,,,,Thyroid_mRNA,Liver_mRNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,T3,T4,TSH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine whether widely used brominated flame retardants and pesticides affect TR-mediated gene expression, those with organohalogen, which is also present in T3, were screened. To monitor the TR-mediated gene expression, HeLaTR cells were transfected with a luciferase gene that was linked to the thyroid hormone responsive element. Thus, transcription of the luciferase gene in HeLaTR cells is driven by TR. By screening 38 chemical agents, it was found that 4,4'-diiodobiphenyl (DIB), markedly, and 1,2,5,6,9,10-hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) and nitrofen (NIP), to a much lesser extent but significantly, enhanced the expression of the luciferase gene at concentrations that did not affect the growth of HeLaTR cells. DIB also augmented the E2-induced expression of the luciferase gene that was linked to the estrogen responsive element in MCF7 cells, whereas HBCD and NIP did not. These results indicate that DIB augments TR- and ER-mediated gene expression, but HBCD and NIP affect only TR-mediated gene expression.

Compared to controls, 0.1 ppm arsenic had no effect on TPO activity. Incubation for 2 min in the presence of 1.0, 5.0, or 10 ppm arsenic inhibited TPO activity to 4%, 9%, and 9% of control, respectively.

Although co-planar PCB have been detected at microgram per kilogram levels in fish from contaminated areas, few studies have examined mechanisms whereby, co-planar PCBs may alter thyroid function in fish. We treated immature lake trout by intraperitoneal (i.p.)-injection or dietary gavage with vehicle containing 0, 0.7, 1.2, 25 or 40 microg 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) per kgBW. Blood and tissue samples were collected at various times up to 61 weeks following exposure. The treatments produced sustained dose-dependent elevations of tissue (PCB 126) concentrations. Thyroid epithelial cell height (TECH), plasma thyroxine (T4) and 3,3',5-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3) concentrations, hepatic 5'-monodeiodinase, hepatic glucuronidation of T4 and T3, as well as plasma T4 kinetics and fish growth were analyzed. Exposure to the highest doses of PCB 126 caused increased TECH, plasma T4 dynamics and T4-glucuronidation (T4-G). PCB 126 did not affect 5'-monodeiodinase and T3-glucuronidation (T3-G) and there were no effects on fish growth or condition. Because T3 status and growth were unaffected, the thyroid system was able to compensate for the alterations caused by the PCB 126 exposure. It is clear that concentrations of co-planar PCBs similar to those found in predatory fish from contaminated areas in the Great Lakes are capable of enhancing metabolism of T4. These changes may be of significance when T4 requirements are high for other reasons (e.g. periods of rapid growth, warm temperatures, metamorphosis, and parr-smolt transformation).",15019252,wklaren@21centurytoxicology.com,,1,,,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,"3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126)",,,,,,,Fish,,,,,Yes_LifeStage,,,,,,,Immature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO,,,,,Sulfation_Glucuronidation,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,TH_ADME_PBPK,,,Chemical_ADME_PBPK,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,"This article covers several different MIEs which may be of interest to investigators.

C.",Changes in thyroid peroxidase activity in response to various chemicals,"Thyroperoxidase (TPO) is a large heme-containing glycoprotein that catalyzes the transfer of iodine to thyroglobulin during thyroid hormone (TH) synthesis. Previously, we established an in vitro assay for TPO activity based on human recombinant TPO (hrTPO) stably transfected into human follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC-238) cells. It is important to determine whether environmental chemicals can disrupt TPO activity because it is an important factor in the TH axis. In this study, we used our assay to examine the changes in TPO activity in response to various chemicals, including benzophenones (BPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Overall, BPs, PAHs, and POPs slightly altered TPO activity at low doses, as compared with the positive controls methimazole (MMI), genistein, and 2,2',4,4'-tetrahydroxy BP.

Here, we examined whether selected EDCs inhibit the key reactions of TH biosynthesis catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase (TPO). We used a novel in vitro assay based on human recombinant TPO (hrTPO) stably transfected into the human follicular thyroid carcinoma cell line FTC-238. F21388 (synthetic flavonoid), bisphenol A (building block for polycarbonates), and the UV filter benzophenone 2 (BP2) inhibited hrTPO. BP2 is contained in numerous cosmetics of daily use and may be in regular contact with human skin. Half-maximal inhibition in the guaiacol assay occurred at 450 nmol/liter BP2, a concentration 20- and 200-fold lower than those required in case of the TPO-inhibiting antithyroid drugs methimazole and propylthiouracil, respectively. BP2 at 300 nmol/liter combined with the TPO substrate H(2)O(2) (10 mumol/liter) inactivated hrTPO; this was, however, prevented by micromolar amounts of iodide. BP2 did not inhibit iodide uptake into FRTL-5 cells. In BP2-treated rats (333 and 1000 mg/kg body weight), serum total T(4) was significantly decreased and serum thyrotropin was significantly increased. TPO activities in the thyroids of treated animals were unchanged, a finding also described for methimazole and propylthiouracil. Thus, EDCs, most potently BP2, may disturb TH homeostasis by inhibiting or inactivating TPO, effects that are even more pronounced in the absence of iodide.

Unlike the cyclic thioureylenes, thiourea at 5 mM has no effect on guaiacol oxidation. If iodide is added to guaiacol assays containing thiourea, enzyme activity is lost. The latter observation may be explained as follows. In the presence of iodide, the iodinating species [TPO.Ioxid], oxidizes thiourea to formamidine disulfide. This product decomposes to cyanamide at neutral pH. We have shown cyanamide to be an inhibitor of the peroxidative and iodinating functions of TPO. Studies in rats demonstrate that doses of thiourea which completely inhibit in vivo protein-bound iodine formation have no irreversible effect on TPO, as measured by guaiacol peroxidation after removal of the thyroids. The major in vivo action of cyanamide is similar to that of thiourea. The data suggest that the primary in vivo and in vitro mode of action of thiourea is the reversible Ioxid-trapping mechanism. The anomalous inhibition of guaiacol peroxidation seen in the presence of thiourea plus iodide derives from the formation of formamide disulfide, followed by its nonenzymic decomposition to cyanamide.",436767,mheintz,,1,,In_Vitro,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,"Thiourea cyanamide",Rodent,,,,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TPO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,[JU reviewer note: TiAb is old paper and could be read as primary study or review; left original reviewer's form as if it were a primary study.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TPO_activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Guaiacol_oxidation,,,,,Thyroid_activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[JU reviewer note: Q11 - was blank, I selected ""thyroid"" based on the statement ""Studies in rats demonstrate that doses of thiourea which completely inhibit in vivo protein-bound iodine formation have no irreversible effect on TPO, as measured by guaiacol peroxidation after removal of the thyroids.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zygotic expression of TPO was detected in neurula stage embryos. Expression was observed in the notochord and later in the thyroid. The notochord was also a common site of expression for 5'DII and 5DIII. Other sites of 5'DII expression are the otic vesicles, retina, liver, blood-forming region, branchial arches and brain. 5DIII is also expressed in the brain, retina, liver, developing pro-nephros, blood-forming region and branchial arches. Embryos exposed to the TPO inhibitor methimazole showed a distinctive dose-dependent phenotype of a crimped notochord and shortened axis, together with alterations in (125)I(-) uptake.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>These data suggest a novel extrathyroidal role for TH during early development, and support the proposal that embryos require thyroid signalling for normal development prior to metamorphosis.",17073826,gchappell@toxstrategies.com,,1,,,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,methimazole,,,,,,Amphibian,,,,,,Yes_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Embryo,,,,,,,,,,NIS,TPO,,,DIO,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,,,,,NIS_activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Radioiodine_uptake,,,,,,Other_tissue_activity_source,embryo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TPO_mRNA,,,,,Expression,,,,,,,,Thyroid_mRNA,Other_tissue_mRNA_source,notochord|otic vesicles|retina|liver|blood-forming region|brachial arches|brain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO2,DIO3,DIO_mRNA,,,,Expression,,,,,,,,,Thyroid_mRNA,Liver_mRNA,Brain_mRNA,,,,Other_tissue_mRNA_source,notochord|otic vesicles|retina|blood-forming region|brachial arches,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amphibian_development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NH-3 binds Xenopus laevis thyroid hormone receptors directly in vitro and induces a conformation distinct from agonist-bound receptors. Transcriptional activation of a thyroid hormone response element-containing reporter gene is strongly inhibited by NH-3 in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, NH-3 prevents X. laevis thyroid hormone receptors from binding to the p160 family of co-activators GRIP-1 and SRC-1 in a two-hybrid assay. To assess the potency of the compound in vivo, we used induced and spontaneous X. laevis tadpole metamorphosis, a thyroid hormone-dependent developmental process. NH-3 inhibits thyroid hormone-induced morphological changes in a dose-dependent manner and inhibits the up-regulation of endogenous thyroid hormone-responsive genes. Spontaneous metamorphosis is efficiently and reversibly arrested by NH-3 with at least the same effectiveness as the thyroid hormone synthesis inhibitor methimazole. Therefore, NH-3 is the first thyroid hormone antagonist to demonstrate potent inhibition of thyroid hormone action in both cell culture- and whole animal-based assays.",12095994,mheintz,,1,,In_Vitro,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,"NH-3 methimazole",,,,,,Amphibian,,,,,,Yes_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Metamorphosis,Tadpole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TR,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,"[JU reviewer note: Q1. added ""in vitro"" since the TiAb described both in vitro and in vivo experiments.

W.",Cross-species analysis of thyroperoxidase inhibition by xenobiotics demonstrates conservation of response between pig and rat,"Thyroperoxidase (TPO), the enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of thyroid hormone, is a known target for thyroid-disrupting chemicals. In vivo toxicological evidence supporting TPO-inhibition as one molecular-initiating event that leads to thyroid disruption is derived largely from rat models; however, a significant fraction of research on the inhibition of TPO by xenobiotics has been conducted using porcine TPO. The current work tested the hypothesis that porcine and rat thyroid microsomes exposed to TPO-inhibiting chemicals would demonstrate different responses in a guaiacol oxidation assay. A primary objective of this work is to establish the degree of concordance between rat and porcine TPO inhibition data. Microsomes were isolated from both rat and pig thyroid glands, and the guaiacol oxidation assay was performed for a training set of 12 chemicals, including previously reported TPO inhibitors, thyroid-disrupting chemicals thought to perturb other targets, and several previously untested chemicals, to determine the relative TPO inhibition responses across species. Concentration-response curves were derived for methimazole (MMI), dibutylphthalate (DBP), diethylhexylphthalate (DEHP), diethylphthalate (DEP), 3,5-dimethylpyrazole-1-methanol (DPM), iopanoic acid (IOA), 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT), sodium perchlorate (PERC), p-nonylphenol (PNP), 4-propoxyphenol (4POP), 6-propylthiouracil (PTU), and triclosan (TCS). MMI, PTU, MBT, DPM, 4POP, and at extremely high concentrations, PERC, inhibited TPO activity. Results demonstrated a strong qualitative concordance of response between the two species. All chemicals that inhibited TPO in porcine microsomes also inhibited TPO in rat microsomes. Hill model-derived IC50 values revealed approximate 1.5- to 50-fold differences in relative potency to MMI between species for positive chemicals. DPM, MBT, 4POP, and PTU exhibited greater relative potency to MMI using rat TPO versus porcine TPO, but rank order potency for inhibition was similar for the other test chemicals, with: PTU&gt;MBT&gt;DPM&gt;4POP&gt;PERC for rat TPO and MBT&gt;PTU&gt;DPM&gt;4POP&gt;PERC for porcine TPO.

The structure-activity relationships of 44 halogenated compounds for IYD-inhibitory activity were examined in vitro using microsomes of HEK-293 T cells expressing recombinant human IYD. The compounds examined were 17 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 15 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), two agrichemicals, five antiparasitics, two pharmaceuticals and three food colorants. Among them, 25 halogenated phenolic compounds inhibited IYD activity at the concentration of 1×10(-4)M or 6×10(-4)M.

O.",Development of a thyroperoxidase inhibition assay for high-throughput screening,"High-throughput screening (HTPS) assays to detect inhibitors of thyroperoxidase (TPO), the enzymatic catalyst for thyroid hormone (TH) synthesis, are not currently available. Herein we describe the development of a HTPS TPO inhibition assay. Rat thyroid microsomes and a fluorescent peroxidase substrate, Amplex UltraRed (AUR, LifeTechnologies), were employed in an endpoint assay for comparison to the existing kinetic guaiacol (GUA) oxidation assay. Following optimization of assay metrics including Z', dynamic range, and activity using methimazole (MMI), the assay was tested with a 21-chemical training set. The potency of MMI-induced TPO inhibition was greater with AUR compared to GUA. The dynamic range and Z' score with MMI were as follows: 127-fold and 0.62 for the GUA assay, 18-fold and 0.86 for the 96-well AUR assay, and 11.5-fold and 0.93 for the 384-well AUR assay. The 384-well AUR assay drastically reduced animal use, requiring one-tenth of the rat thyroid microsomal protein needed for the GUA 96-well format assay.

Exposures to chemicals, including chlorpyrifos, have been found to modify thyroid signaling at environmentally relevant levels in animal studies. The aim of this study was to examine circulating T4 and TSH levels in relation to urinary concentrations of 3, 5, 6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPY), a metabolite of the organophosphorus insecticides chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-methyl, using data from individuals 12 years and older from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). NHANES datasets from 1999 to 2000 and 2001-2002 were combined, and individuals with thyroid disease, those taking thyroid medications, and pregnant women were excluded (N = 3249). Multivariable linear regression models for relationships between log-transformed urinary TCPY and serum total T(4) or log (TSH) were constructed adjusting for important covariates. Models were stratified by sex and a categorical age variable (12-18, 18-40, 40-60, and &gt;60 years). In male participants, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in urinary TCPY was associated with statistically significant increases in serum T(4) of 3.8% (95th CI 0.75 to 7.0) among those 12-18 years of age and 3.5% (95th CI 0.13 to 7.0) in the 18-40 year age group, relative to median T4 levels using unweighted models. An IQR increase in TCPY was also associated with decreases in TSH of 10.7% (-18.7-2.05) among men 18-40 years old and 20.0% (95th CI -28.9 to -9.86) among men &gt;60 years old. Conversely, urinary TCPY was positively associated with TSH in females &gt;60 years of age.

3012235,"Roberts, S. C., Bianco, A. C., Stapleton, H. M.",Disruption of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase activity in cultured human glial cells by polybrominated diphenyl ethers,"Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants are endocrine disruptors and suspected neurodevelopmental toxicants. While the direct mechanisms of neurodevelopmental toxicity have not been fully elucidated, it is conceivable that alterations in thyroid hormone levels in the developing brain may contribute to these effects. Cells within the brain locally convert thyroxine (T-4) to the biologically active triiodothyronine (T-3) through the action of the selenodeiodinase type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO2). Previous studies have demonstrated that PBDEs can alter hepatic deiodinase activity both in vitro and in vivo; however, the effects of PBDEs on the deiodinase isoforms expressed in the brain are not well understood. Here, we studied the effects of several individual PBDEs and hydroxylated metabolites (OH-BDEs) on DIO2 activity in astrocytes, a specialized glial cell responsible for production of more than 50% of the T3 required by the brain. Primary human astrocytes and H4 glioma cells were exposed to individual PBDEs or OH-BDEs at concentrations up to 5 mu M. BDE-99 decreased DIO2 activity by 50% in primary astrocyte cells and by up to 80% in the H4 cells at doses of >= 500 nM. 3-OH-BDE-47, 6-OH-BDE-47, and 5'-OH-BDE-99 also decreased DIO2 activity in cultured H4 glioma cells by 45-80% at doses of approximately 1-5 mu M. Multiple mechanisms appear to contribute to the decreased DIO2 activity, including weakened expression of DIO2 mRNA, competitive inhibition of DIO2, and enhanced post-translational degradation of DIO2. We conclude that decreases in DIO2 activity caused by exposure to PBDEs may play a role in the neurodevelopmental deficits caused by these toxicants.",26004626,mheintz,,1,,In_Vitro,,,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,"BDE-99 3-OH-BDE-47 6-OH-BDE-47 5'-OH-BDE-99",,Human,,,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO2,,DIO_mRNA,,DIO_activity,,Expression,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_cell_mRNA_source,Primary human astrocytes | H4 glioma cells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_cell_activity_source,Primary human astrocytes | H4 glioma cells,,,Other_models_used,post-translational degradation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The potential for a set of 6 benzothiazoles to affect endpoints related to thyroid hormone synthesis inhibition were assessed using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo assays. Inhibition of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) derived from pig thyroid glands was determined for benzothiazole (BTZ), 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT), 5-chloro-2-mercaptobenzothiazole (CMBT), 2-aminobenzothiazole (ABT), 2-hydroxybenzothiazole (HBT), and 2-methylthiobenzothiazole (MTBT). Their rank order potency for TPO inhibition was MBT=CMBT>ABT>BTZ, whereas HBT and MTBT exhibited no inhibitory activity. The benzothiazoles were tested further in a Xenopus laevis thyroid gland explant culture assay in which inhibition of thyroxine (T4) release was the measured endpoint. In this assay all 6 benzothiazoles inhibited T4 release. The activity of the benzothiazoles for disrupting thyroid hormone activity was verified in vivo using X. laevis tadpoles in a 7-day assay. The 2 most potent chemicals for TPO inhibition, MBT and CMBT, produced responses in vivo indicative of T4 synthesis inhibition including induction of sodium iodide symporter mRNA and decreases in glandular and circulating thyroid hormones. The capability to measure thyroid hormone levels in the glands and blood by ultrahigh performance LC-MS/MS methods optimized for small tissue samples was critical for effects interpretation.

H., Aarts, J., Rietjens, I.",Simple and Rapid In Vitro Assay for Detecting Human Thyroid Peroxidase Disruption,"A simple and rapid luminometric assay for the detection of chemical inhibitors of human thyroid peroxidase (hTPO) activity was developed and validated with 10 model compounds. hTPO was derived from the human thyroid follicular cell line Nthy-ori 3-1 and its activity was quantified by measuring the oxidation of luminol in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which results in emission of light at 428 nm. In this assay, hTPO activity was shown to be inhibited by 5 known TPO inhibitors and not inhibited by 5 non-inhibitors. Similar results were obtained with porcine TPO (pTPO). The inhibition of hTPO by the model compounds was also tested with guaiacol and Ampliflu Red as alternative indicator substrates. While all substrates allowed the detection of pTPO activity and its inhibition, only the Ampliflu Red and luminol-based methods were sensitive enough to allow the quantification of hTPO activity from Nthy-ori 3-1 cell lysates. Moreover, luminol gave results with a narrower 95% confidence interval and therefore more reliable data. Whole extracts of fast-growing Nthy-ori 3-1 cells circumvent the need for animal-derived thyroid organs, thereby reducing costs, eliminating potential contamination and providing the possibility to study human instead of porcine TPO. Overall, the application of luminol and Nthy-ori 3-1 cell lysate for the detection of the disruption of hTPO activity was found to represent a valuable in vitro alternative and a possible candidate for inclusion within a high throughput integrated testing strategy for the detection of compounds that potentially interfere with normal thyroid function in vivo.",25822105,wklaren@21centurytoxicology.com,,1,,In_Vitro,,,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,"5 known TPO inhibitors 5 non-inhibitors",,Human,Other_Mammal,porcine,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TPO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TPO_activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Guaiacol_oxidation,Amplex_UltraRed_(AUR),,Other_activity_method,luminol oxidation,,,,,,,,,Other_cell_activity_source,Nthy-ori 3-1 cell lysates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested whether TKI are able to inhibit MCT8-mediated TH uptake into cells.<br /><br /><strong>DESIGN: </strong>Madin-Darby-canine kidney (MDCK1) cells stably expressing human MCT8 were exposed in vitro to TKI at increasing concentrations, and MCT8-mediated [(125)I]T(3) uptake and efflux were measured. The mode of inhibition was determined.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>TKI exposure dose-dependently inhibited MCT8-dependent T(3) and T(4) uptake. IC(50) values for sunitinib, imatinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib ranged from 13-38 μm, i.e. similar to the Michaelis-Menten constant K(m) for T(3) and T(4), 4 and 8 μm, respectively. Kinetic experiments revealed a noncompetitive mode of inhibition for all TKI tested.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Partial inhibition by TKI of pituitary or hypothalamic TH feedback may increase TSH or increase the levothyroxine requirement of thyroidectomized patients. It is still possible that other mechanisms contribute to TKI-mediated impairments of TFT, e.g. altered metabolism of TH.

S.",Transport of thyroid hormones is selectively inhibited by 3-iodothyronamine,"Thyroid hormone transporters are responsible for the cellular uptake of thyroid hormones, which is a prerequisite for their subsequent metabolism and action at nuclear thyroid hormone receptors. A recently discovered thyroid hormone derivative, 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM), has distinct biological effects that are opposite those of thyroid hormone. Here we investigate the effects of T(1)AM on thyroid hormone transporters using COS-1 cells transfected with the multispecific organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) 1A2, 1B3, and 1C1, as well as the specific thyroid hormone transporters MCT8 and MCT10, and show that T(1)AM displays differential inhibition of T(3) and T(4) cellular uptake by these transporters. T(1)AM inhibits T(3) and T(4) transport by OATP1A2 with IC(50) values of 0.27 and 2.1 microM, respectively. T(4) transport by OATP1C1, which is thought to play a key role in thyroid hormone transport across the blood-brain barrier, is inhibited by T(1)AM with an IC(50) of 4.8 microM. T(1)AM also inhibits both T(3) and T(4) uptake via MCT8, the most specific thyroid hormone transporter identified to date, with IC(50) values of 95 and 31 microM, respectively. By contrast, T(1)AM has no effect on thyroid hormone transport by OATP1B3 and MCT10. Given that OATP1A2, OATP1C1, and MCT8 are all present in the brain, T(1)AM may play an important role in modulating thyroid hormone delivery and activity in specific target regions in the central nervous system.",20358049,gchappell@toxstrategies.com,,1,,In_Vitro,,,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM),,,Other_Mammal,monkey,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mem_Transporters,,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,unclear from what species the transfected transporter genes originated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MCT8,MCT10,OATP1C1,,,,,,Other_MT,OATP1A2|OATP1B3,,,MT_activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,T3_T4_uptake_efflux,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_cell_activity_source,COS-1,Genetic_model_type,cells transfected with transporter-encoding genes,,,,,,,,,,,,Thyronamines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

R.",Differential responses to ligands of overexpressed thyroid hormone and retinoid X receptors in a Xenopus cell line and in vivo,"In an attempt to explain the contrasting patterns of expression of Xenopus thyroid hormone (xTR) and retinoid X (xRXR) receptor genes and to extend our understanding of the role of heterodimerization of these receptors during amphibian metamorphosis, we have investigated the response to their respective ligands of cells in which xTR and xRXR were overexpressed. Results obtained with two separate approaches are now described. In the first, 3,3'5-triiodothyronine (t3) was found to strongly upregulate xTR beta mRNA in XTC-2 cells, but not of xTR alpha or xRXR alpha mRNAs, while xRXR gamma transcripts could not be detected. 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) did not substantially influence the expression of any of these four receptor genes. When transcription from three different thyroid response elements (TREs) (a palindromic TREpal, an inverted repeat +6 [F2] and a direct repeat +4[DR+4] as present in the promoter of xTR beta gene) was measured in XTC-2 cells in which xTR beta and xRXR alpha were overexpressed, only T3 upregulated transcription while 9-cis-RA, alone or together with T3, was ineffective. 9-cis-RA however enhanced transcription from an RXR responsive element (RXR-RE). THe second approach involved overexpression of xTR beta and xRXR alpha in premetamorphic Xenopus tadpole tail muscle followed by measuring the response of the tails to T3 in organ culture. After validating the microinjection/culture procedure histochemically, we found that T3 enhanced transcription from the xTR beta DR +4 TRE in tails in which xTR beta was overexpressed but the overexpression of xRXR alpha failed to modify this response. It is concluded that in both XTC cells and tadpole tails, overexpressed xRXR fails to modify the enhanced transcriptional response of endogenous and overexpressed xTR beta to T3 and that exogenous 9-cis-RA is ineffective.",9027359,wklaren@21centurytoxicology.com,,1,,In_Vitro,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,"3,3'5-triiodothyronine (t3) 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA)",,,,,,Amphibian,,,,,,Yes_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Metamorphosis,,,,,,Other_Lifestage,pre-metamorphic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TR,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,Yes_Crosstalk,Thyroid & RXR,Primary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Retinoic Acid Receptor,,

Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that interfere with thyroid functions raise serious concerns due to their frequent misuse in areas where regulations are poorly implemented. In addition, chemicals that are originally regarded safe may now be considered as toxic with the development of life sciences. Malathion is an organophosphate insecticide that is widely applied and distributed in agricultural and residential settings. Due to the low acute toxicity and rapid degradation, malathion is not listed as a primary thyroid disrupting chemical. However, emerging evidences reported that malathion affected thyroperoxidase catalyzed iodide oxidation which in turn influenced thyroid hormone transportation, and enhanced parathyroid hyperplasia prevalence. Nevertheless, direct effect of malathion on thyroid hormone biosynthesis remains to be elucidated. This study investigated the effects of thyroid disruption of malathion in Fischer rat thyroid follicular cell line, FRTL-5. Transcriptional and translational analyses on thyroglobulin demonstrated that both mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly inhibited by malathion. Cellular cAMP level and TSH receptor expression were distinctly reduced by malathion (6.0 µg/ml). These results suggested that malathion directly disrupted the biosynthesis of thyroid hormone and the mechanism involved down-regulation of TSH receptor and cellular cAMP. This subsequently led to the suppression of TSH dependent signal transduction, TG transcription inhibition, and obstruction of thyroid hormone biosynthesis.",29143548,wklaren@21centurytoxicology.com,,1,,In_Vitro,,,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,malathion,Rodent,,,,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TSHR,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,Other_biological_events,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,"While the introductory text makes note of developmental effects of disrupted thyroid, the experiments conducted do not look into it.

Most assays correctly identified and quantified the model compounds as agonists or antagonists, with the reporter gene assays being the most sensitive. However, the reporter gene assays did not detect significant thyroid activity in any of the water samples, suggesting that activation or inhibition of the thyroid hormone receptor is not a relevant mode of action for thyroid endocrine disruptors in water. The thyroperoxidase (TPO) inhibition assay and transthyretin (TTR) displacement assay (FITC) detected activity in the surface water and treated wastewater samples, but more work is required to assess if this activity is a true measure of thyroid activity or matrix interference.

The importance of TBTCl as an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) in different animal models is well known; however, its adverse effects on the thyroid gland are less understood. Hence, in the present study, we aimed to evaluate the thyroid-disrupting effects of this chemical using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. We used HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells for the in vitro studies, as they are a thyroid hormone receptor (TR)-positive and thyroid responsive cell line. For the in vivo studies, Swiss albino male mice were exposed to three doses of TBTCl (0.5, 5 and 50μg/kg/day) for 45days. TBTCl showed a hypo-thyroidal effect in vivo. Low-dose treatment of TBTCl exposure markedly decreased the serum thyroid hormone levels via the down-regulation of the thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg) genes by 40% and 25%, respectively, while augmenting the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) expression was up-regulated in the thyroid glands of treated mice by 6.6-fold relative to vehicle-treated mice (p&lt;0.05). In the transient transactivation assays, TBTCl suppressed T3 mediated transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, TBTCl was found to decrease the expression of TR. The present study thus indicates that low concentrations of TBTCl suppress TR transcription by disrupting the physiological concentrations of T3/T4, followed by the recruitment of NCoR to TR, providing a novel insight into the thyroid hormone-disrupting effects of this chemical.",25101840,gchappell@toxstrategies.com,,1,,In_Vitro,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,tributyltin chloride (TBTCl),Rodent,Human,,,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TPO,,,,,,,,,,,TSHR,TR,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TPO_mRNA,,,,,Expression,,,,,,,,Thyroid_mRNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"not clear if TPO was also measured in vitro; did not include here.

We investigated a possible role of estrogen on thyroid follicular cell growth using rat FRTL-5 thyroid follicular cells as a model. Estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) messenger RNA was present in FRTL-5 cells using a RT-PCR assay and was confirmed by Western blot analysis. An estrogen-responsive reporter gene was transfected into FRTL-5 cells to test the functionality of the endogenous ERs. Estradiol increased the activity of the reporter gene, and the antagonist, ICI182780, inhibited ER-dependent transcription. To extend this analysis, we examined the effect of estradiol on FRTL-5 cell growth. Estradiol increased FRTL-5 cell growth in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in either the absence or presence of TSH. Because iodine is known to inhibit thyroid cell growth, the effect of estradiol on the expression of the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) was assessed as a potential target of estrogen action. Estradiol blocked TSH-induced NIS expression, and treatment of cells with estradiol and ICI182780 restored TSH-induced NIS expression to normal levels. These data demonstrate that FRTL-5 cells contain functional ERs that enhance cell growth and inhibit expression of the NIS.

PTU increased 5'-1880-bp and 5'-1052-bp activity of the rat NIS promoter. While PTU treatment also increased NIS protein levels, the size of the induced protein was smaller than that induced by TSH, and the protein localized predominantly in the cytoplasm rather than the plasma membrane.

Estrogen-related receptor γ (ERRγ) is a member of the orphan nuclear receptors with important functions in cell development and homeostasis. However, there are no reports that demonstrate whether ERRγ is related to NIS function. Here, we evaluated the role of ERRγ in the regulation of NIS function in ATC cells using GSK5182, an inverse agonist of ERRγ.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>Two ATC cell lines, BHT-101 and CAL62, were incubated with GSK5182 at various time points and doses. The NIS function in the ATC cells was serially assessed by their uptake of radioiodine. The effects of GSK5182 on ERRγ and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, as well as on NIS protein, were evaluated by immunoblot assay. To examine whether the GSK5182-induced NIS functional activity can be affected by inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway, the MAP kinase activity and levels of radioiodine uptake were determined after application of a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor to GSK5182-treated cells. Finally, the cytotoxic effect of (131)I was determined by clonogenic assay.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Treatment with GSK5182 resulted in dose- and time-dependent increases in iodide uptake in ATC cells, which were accompanied by both the downregulation of ERRγ protein and the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. Both the increased radioiodine uptake and ERK1/2 activation of ATC cells were completely inhibited by the specific MEK inhibitor. GSK5182 treatment enhanced the membrane localization of NIS in both ATC cell lines. Accordingly, preexposure to GSK5182 enhanced the cytotoxic effects of (131)I treatment in ATC cells.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>These findings suggest that the inverse agonist of ERRγ enhances the responsiveness of radioiodine therapy by modulating NIS function in ATC cells via the regulation of ERRγ and the MAP kinase signaling pathway.",26338896,mheintz,,1,,In_Vitro,,,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,"GSK5182 mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor (131)I",,Human,,,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,EAS_pathway,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,Yes_Crosstalk,role of ERRγ in the regulation of NIS function,Primary,,,,,,"[JU reviewer note: Q9-10.

In this paper, we present a case-study demonstrating the selection of alternative in chemico assays targeting the molecular initiating events of established AOPs, and evaluate use of the resulting data to predict higher level biological endpoints. Based on two AOPs linking inhibition of the deiodinase (DIO) enzymes to impaired posterior swim bladder inflation in fish, we used in chemico enzyme inhibition assays to measure the molecular initiating events for an array of 51 chemicals. Zebrafish embryos were then exposed to 14 compounds with different measured inhibition potentials. Effects on posterior swim bladder inflation, predicted based on the information captured by the AOPs, were evaluated. By linking the two datasets and setting thresholds, we were able to demonstrate that the in chemico dataset can be used to predict biological effects on posterior chamber inflation, with only two outliers out of the 14 tested compounds. Our results show how information organized using the AOP framework can be employed to develop or select alternative assays, and successfully forecast downstream key events along the AOP.

We have investigated in vitro the effect of 2-IHDA on the NADPH-oxidase, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) activities of a porcine thyroid plasma membrane preparation. 2-IHDA inhibited NADPH-oxidase activity, with half-inhibition at 3-5 microM, but it had no effect on NADPH-cytochrome c reductase. It inhibited the TPO-catalyzed iodination of protein, but not iodide oxidation. Hexadecanal also inhibited NADPH-oxidase. Inhibition by the non-iodinated lipid aldehydes depended on the length of their aliphatic chain: dodecanal and tridecanal gave maximal inhibition. Free iodide, 2-iodohexadecanol and palmitic acid all had no inhibitory effect. Washing treated membranes showed that the inhibition of NADPH-oxidase by hexadecanal was fully reversible, whereas that of 2-IHDA and other iodinated or brominated alkanals was irreversible.

We have investigated in vitro the effect of 2-IHDA on the NADPH-oxidase, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) activities of a porcine thyroid plasma membrane preparation. 2-IHDA inhibited NADPH-oxidase activity, with half-inhibition at 3-5 microM, but it had no effect on NADPH-cytochrome c reductase. It inhibited the TPO-catalyzed iodination of protein, but not iodide oxidation. Hexadecanal also inhibited NADPH-oxidase. Inhibition by the non-iodinated lipid aldehydes depended on the length of their aliphatic chain: dodecanal and tridecanal gave maximal inhibition. Free iodide, 2-iodohexadecanol and palmitic acid all had no inhibitory effect. Washing treated membranes showed that the inhibition of NADPH-oxidase by hexadecanal was fully reversible, whereas that of 2-IHDA and other iodinated or brominated alkanals was irreversible.

J., Vulsma, T.",High incidence of thyroid dysfunction despite prophylaxis with potassium iodide during (131)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine treatment in children with neuroblastoma,"<strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>Treatment modalities like targeted radiotherapy with (131)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine ((131)I-MIBG) improve survival rates after neuroblastoma (NB). Radiation to the thyroid gland can lead to hypothyroidism and even malignancy. Because hypothyroidism after (131)I-MIBG treatment was reported, the current KI prophylaxis against thyroidal radiation damage was evaluated.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>The incidence, pathogenesis, and consequences of thyroid dysfunction among 42 NB patients treated with (131)I-MIBG were evaluated retrospectively. Efficacy of KI prophylaxis was established by measuring thyroidal radioiodide uptake. Thyroid damage was expressed as thyrotropin elevation (TE, plasma concentration of thyroid stimulating hormone > or = 4.5 mU/L).<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>The mean followup was 2.3 years (range, 0.1-8.5). The mean number of treatments with (131)I-MIBG was 3.3. Of 428 scintigrams, uptake of (131)I in the thyroid was visible in 92 (21.0%). Twenty two patients (52.4 %) presented TE after a mean period of 1.4 years (range, 0.1-5.8). Clinical signs of hypothyroidism were not observed. Eight patients received suppletion therapy with thyroxine. Thyrotropin elevation was transient in four patients. Of 25 survivors, with a mean followup of 3.5 years, 16 (64%) developed TE. No correlation was found between TE and thyroid visualization after (131)I-MIBG administration or the number of treatments. No abnormalities were seen by ultrasound imaging of the thyroid.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Occurrence of thyroid dysfunction after treatment with (131)I-MIBG for NB is high, in spite of KI prophylaxis.

The mechanism of these changes remains obscure and raises questions regarding the regulation of intracellular availability and metabolism of TH. To study the pathophysiology of MCT8 deficiency, we generated Mct8 knockout mice. Male mice deficient in Mct8 (Mct8(-/y)) replicate the thyroid abnormalities observed in affected men. TH deprivation and replacement with L-T3 showed that suppression of TSH required higher serum levels T3 in Mct8(-/y) than wild-type (WT) littermates, indicating hypothalamus and/or thyrotroph resistance to T3. Furthermore, T4 is required to maintain the high serum T3 level because the latter was not different between the two genotypes during administration of T3. Mct8(-/y) mice have 2.3-fold higher T3 content in liver associated with 6.1- and 3.1-fold increase in deiodinase 1 mRNA and enzymatic activity, respectively. The relative T3 excess in liver of Mct8(-/y) mice produced a decrease in serum cholesterol (79 +/- 18 vs. 137 +/- 38 mg/dl in WT) and an increase in alkaline phosphatase (107 +/- 23 vs. 58 +/- 3 U/liter in WT) levels.

Our results showed that the enzymatic activity was highly susceptible to inhibition by 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil and gold thioglucose, its preferential substrate was reverse tri-iodothyronine (rT(3)), it exhibited a low dithiothreitol requirement (5 mM), and the apparent K(m) and V(max) values for substrate (rT(3)) were approximately 0.25 microM and 9.0 pmol liberated/mg protein per hour, respectively. All these characteristics indicate the preferential expression of type 1 deiodinase (D1), which was corroborated by demonstrating the presence of D1 mRNA in prostate. D1 activity was detected in all lobes and was most abundant in the dorsolateral. Although we detected type 2 deiodinase (D2) mRNA expression, the D2 activity was almost undetectable. D1 activity was enhanced in animals with hyperthyroidism and hyperprolactinemia, in intact animals treated with finasteride (inhibitor of local DHT production), and in castrated animals with E(2) replacement. In contrast, activity diminished in castrated animals with testosterone replacement. Our results suggest that thyroid hormones, PRL, and E(2) exert a positive modulation on D1 activity, while testosterone and DHT exhibit an inhibitory effect.

6556922,"Rabah, S. A., Gowan, I. L., Pagnin, M., Osman, N., Richardson, S. J.",Thyroid Hormone Distributor Proteins During Development in Vertebrates,"Thyroid hormones (THs) are ancient hormones that not only influence the growth, development and metabolism of vertebrates but also affect the metabolism of (at least some) bacteria. Synthesized in the thyroid gland (or follicular cells in fish not having a discrete thyroid gland), THs can act on target cells by genomic or non-genomic mechanisms. Either way, THs need to get from their site of synthesis to their target cells throughout the body. Despite being amphipathic in structure, THs are lipophilic and hence do not freely diffuse in the aqueous environments of blood or cerebrospinal fluid (in contrast to hydrophilic hormones). TH Distributor Proteins (THDPs) have evolved to enable the efficient distribution of THs in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. In humans, the THDPs are albumin, transthyretin (TTR), and thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG). These three proteins have distinct patterns of regulation in both ontogeny and phylogeny. During development, an additional THDP with higher affinity than those in the adult, is present during the stage of peak TH concentrations in blood. Although TTR is the only THDP synthesized in the central nervous system (CNS), all THDPs from blood are present in the CSF (for each species). However, the ratio of albumin to TTR differs in the CSF compared to the blood. Humans lacking albumin or TBG have been reported and can be asymptomatic, however a human lacking TTR has not been documented. Conversely, there are many diseases either caused by TTR or that have altered levels of TTR in the blood or CSF associated with them. The first world-wide RNAi therapy has just been approved for TTR amyloidosis.",31440205,gchappell@toxstrategies.com,,1,,,,In_Vivo,Clinical_Descriptive,,,,,,No_Chemical,,,Human,,,,,Fish,,Other_Group_Species,vertebrates | bacteria,,Yes_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Adult,,,,,,,,,,,Other_Lifestage,development,,,THBP,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Secondary,Citation_mining_use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TBG,TTR,Albumin,,,,THBP_protein,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Protein_level,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CSF_protein,,,,Other_tissue_protein_source,blood|CNS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Review article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,T3,T4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

M.",Expression of thyroid hormone transporters and deiodinases at the brain barriers in the embryonic chicken: Insights into the regulation of thyroid hormone availability during neurodevelopment,"Thyroid hormones (THs) are key regulators in the development of the vertebrate brain. Therefore, TH access to the developing brain needs to be strictly regulated. The brain barriers separate the central nervous system from the rest of the body and impose specific transport mechanisms on the exchange of molecules between the general circulation and the nervous system. As such they form ideal structures for regulating TH exchange between the blood and the brain. To investigate the mechanism by which the developing brain regulates TH availability, we investigated the ontogenetic expression profiles of TH transporters, deiodinases and the TH distributor protein transthyretin (TTR) at the brain barriers during embryonic and early postnatal development using the chicken as a model. In situ hybridisation revealed expression of the TH transporters monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) and 10 (MCT10), organic anion transporting polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1) and L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) and the inactivating type 3 deiodinase (D3) in the choroid plexus which forms the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. This was confirmed by quantitative PCR which additionally indicated strongly increasing expression of TTR as well as detectable expression of the activating type 2 deiodinase (D2) and the (in)activating type 1 deiodinase (D1). In the brain capillaries forming the blood-brain barrier in situ hybridisation showed exclusive expression of LAT1 and D2. The combined presence of LAT1 and D2 in brain capillaries suggests that the blood-brain barrier forms the main route for receptor-active T3 uptake into the embryonic chicken brain. Expression of multiple transporters, deiodinases and TTR in the choroid plexus indicates that the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier is also important in regulating early TH availability. The impact of these barrier systems can be deduced from the clear difference in T3 and T4 levels as well as the T3/T4 ratio between the developing brain and the general circulation. We conclude that the tight regulation of TH exchange at the brain barriers from early embryonic stages is one of the factors needed to allow the brain to develop within a relative microenvironment.",25745816,mheintz,,1,,,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,No_Chemical,,,,,,Bird,,,,,,,Yes_LifeStage,,,,Postnatal,,,,,,,,,,,,,Embryo,,,,,,,,,,,,THBP,Mem_Transporters,DIO,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO1,DIO2,DIO3,DIO_mRNA,,,,Expression,,,,ISH,PCR,,,,,,Brain_mRNA,choroid plexus | blood–brain barrier | blood–CSF barrier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TTR,,,,THBP_mRNA,,,,Expression,,,,,PCR,,,,,Brain_mRNA,choroid plexus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MCT8,MCT10,OATP1C1,,LAT1,,,,,,MT_mRNA,,,,Expression,,,,ISH,PCR,,,,,,Brain_mRNA,choroid plexus  | capillaries,,,,,,Blood_CSF_mRNA,BBB_mRNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,T3,T4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While transport of the active form of TH (T3) across the blood-brain barrier is strongly diminished in Mct8 KO animals, prohormone (T4) can still enter the brain, possibly due to the presence of T4-selective organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1C1). Here, we characterized mice deficient for both TH transporters, MCT8 and OATP1C1 (Mct8/Oatp1c1 DKO). Mct8/Oatp1c1 DKO mice exhibited alterations in peripheral TH homeostasis that were similar to those in Mct8 KO mice; however, uptake of both T3 and T4 into the brains of Mct8/Oatp1c1 DKO mice was strongly reduced. Evidence of TH deprivation in the CNS of Mct8/Oatp1c1 DKO mice included highly decreased brain TH content as well as altered deiodinase activities and TH target gene expression. Consistent with delayed cerebellar development and reduced myelination, Mct8/Oatp1c1 DKO mice displayed pronounced locomotor abnormalities. Intriguingly, differentiation of GABAergic interneurons in the cerebral cortex was highly compromised. Our findings underscore the importance of TH transporters for proper brain development and provide a basis to study the pathogenic mechanisms underlying AHDS.",24691440,wklaren@21centurytoxicology.com,,1,,,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,No_Chemical,,Rodent,,,,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mem_Transporters,DIO,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,"A developmental disorder is being investigated but no specific lifestage is being mentioned.

R.",Regulation of thyroid hormone-induced development in vivo by thyroid hormone transporters and cytosolic binding proteins,"Differential tissue sensitivity/responsivity to hormones can explain developmental asynchrony among hormone-dependent events despite equivalent exposure of each tissue to circulating hormone levels. A dramatic vertebrate example is during frog metamorphosis, where transformation of the hind limb, brain, intestine, liver, and tail are completely dependent on thyroid hormone (TH) but occurs asynchronously during development. TH transporters (THTs) and cytosolic TH binding proteins (CTHBPs) have been proposed to affect the timing of tissue transformation based on expression profiles and in vitro studies, but they have not been previously tested in vivo. We used a combination of expression pattern, relative expression level, and in vivo functional analysis to evaluate the potential for THTs (LAT1, OATP1c1, and MCT8) and CTHBPs (PKM2, CRYM, and ALDH1) to control the timing of TH-dependent development. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed complex expression profiles of THTs and CTHBPs with respect to developmental stage, tissue, and TH receptor β (TRβ) expression. For some tissues, the timing of tissue transformation was associated with a peak in the expression of some THTs or CTHBPs. An in vivo overexpression assay by tail muscle injection showed LAT1, PKM2, and CRYM increased TH-dependent tail muscle cell disappearance. Co-overexpression of MCT8 and CRYM had a synergistic effect on cell disappearance. Our data show that each tissue examined has a unique developmental expression profile of THTs and CTHBPs and provide direct in vivo evidence that the ones tested are capable of affecting the timing of developmental responses to TH.",26188717,mheintz,,1,,,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,No_Chemical,,,,,,,Amphibian,,,,,,Yes_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Metamorphosis,,,,,,,,,,,Mem_Transporters,,,,,,,,,,TR,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MCT8,,OATP1C1,,LAT1,,,,,,MT_mRNA,,,,Expression,,,,,PCR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_models_used,In vivo over expression assay by tail muscle injection to assay effects on development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amphibian_development,,,,,,,,Gene_expression,,,,,,,cytosolic TH binding proteins (CTHBPs),"Quantitative PCR analysis revealed complex expression profiles of THTs and CTHBPs with respect to developmental stage, tissue, and TH receptor β (TRβ) expression.",CTHBPs assessed in in vivo over expression assay by tail muscle injection to assess developmental effects

Weight gain and litter size of maternal mice and body weight of offspring were examined. Learning and memory abilities of offspring were tested by the Morris water maze experiment. Thyroid hormones (THs) concentrations in peripheral blood of offspring were detected by the chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay. Relative mRNA expression of type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase (dio1), type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (dio2), and type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase (dio3) in the livers and brains of offspring were measured by QRT-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction). Protein expression of dio3 in the livers and brains of offspring was measured by Western blot. All indexes of offspring were tested at postnatal day (PND) 21 and PND 60, respectively. As a result, administration of BDE209 decreased weight gain and litter size of maternal mice, and reduced body weight of offspring mice, prolonged escape latency and declined guardant time of offspring in the Morris water maze experiment. Moreover, BDE209 elevated serum levels of total thyroxine (T4), total triiodothyronine (T3), free T4, and free T3 in offspring. In addition, maternal exposure to BDE209 inhibited dio1, dio2, dio3 mRNA expression in the livers of offspring, while elevated dio1 mRNA expression and reduced dio3 mRNA expression in the brains of offspring. BDE209 also inhibited the protein expression of dio3 in the livers and brains of offspring.

The development of the auditory system requires thyroid hormone and the cochlea is a primary target tissue. We have proposed that the compartmental anatomy of the cochlea would necessitate transport mechanisms to convey blood-borne hormone to target tissues. We report hearing loss in mice with mutations in Slc16a2 and a related gene Slc16a10 (Mct10, Tat1). Deficiency of both transporters results in retarded development of the sensory epithelium similar to impairment caused by hypothyroidism, compounded with a progressive degeneration of cochlear hair cells and loss of endocochlear potential.

Between 16 days foetal and 60 days postnatal life, the thyroxine (T4)- and tri-iodothyronine (T3)-binding activities of the sera show a striking ontogenic pattern: the binding is 2-3 times higher in foetuses than in mothers, then further increases after birth, reaching between 3 and 5 days maximum values which are 7-8 times higher than the adult ones. This pattern is not correlated with the ontogenesis of the acknowledged specific (transthyretin, TTR) and non-specific (albumin, alpha 1-foetoprotein) thyroid-hormone carriers of the mouse sera. PAGE studies demonstrate that the protein responsible for the elevated binding of the perinatal period is an alpha 1-globulin, with a migration similar to that of human and rat TBGs. Scatchard analysis is consistent with the notions that the T4-binding sites of TBG have high association constants, about two orders of magnitude above the T4 sites of TTR (10(9) M-1 as against 10(7) M-1) and low capacities (37 and 4 nmol/g of serum proteins in pups and adults respectively). Isoelectric focusing (i.e.f.) demonstrates that mouse TBG is a microheterogeneous protein separable, as a function of the pH gradient, in up to 10-12 isoforms, Marked shifts of the relative abundance of isoforms in the course of development are evidenced. The modulation of the TBG binding activity by non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and the control of its synthesis by the thyroid status are also reported. Mono- and poly-unsaturated NEFAs are strong inhibitors of the TBG, although they affect TTR less readily. On the other hand, the biosynthesis and/or secretion of TBG, but not of TTR, is under thyroid-hormone control, experimental hypothyroidism inducing a marked increase of the serum TBG. The TBG of mouse behaves as a highly significant parameter of development, pointing to a likely important function of the protein in the process of maturation. Our finding of major TBGs in both euthyroid rats and mice suggests that TBG is more widely spread than was thought until now, but difficult to detect in certain species outside definite maturation stages.",1700701,mheintz,,1,,,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,"Mono-unsaturated non-esterified fatty acids poly-unsaturated non-esterified fatty acids",Rodent,Human,,,,,,,,,,Yes_LifeStage,,,,Postnatal,,,,Fetus,,Perinatal,,,,Adult,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,THBP,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,"[JU reviewer note: Q4 - also selected ""human"" since used in PAGE assay for comparison.]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TBG,TTR,Albumin,,,,,THBP_activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Serum_activity,,,,,,,,Other_models_used,Isoelectric focusing (i.e.f.),,,[JU reviewer note: Q15 - added ife as other measure of binding proteins.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,T3,T4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this reason, the tadpole is considered to be an ideal bioassay system to identify disruption of thyroid function by environmental contaminants. Here we provide an in-depth review of the amphibian thyroid system with particular focus on the role that TH plays in metamorphosis. The amphibian thyroid system is similar to that of mammals and other tetrapods. We review the amphibian hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, focusing on thyroid hormone synthesis, transport, and metabolism.

J.",Evaluating Iodide Recycling Inhibition as a Novel Molecular Initiating Event for Thyroid Axis Disruption in Amphibians,"The enzyme iodotyrosine deiodinase (dehalogenase, IYD) catalyzes iodide recycling and promotes iodide retention in thyroid follicular cells. Loss of function or chemical inhibition of IYD reduces available iodide for thyroid hormone synthesis, which leads to hormone insufficiency in tissues and subsequent negative developmental consequences. IYD activity is especially critical under conditions of lower dietary iodine and in low iodine environments. Our objective was to evaluate the toxicological relevance of IYD inhibition in a model amphibian (Xenopus laevis) used extensively for thyroid disruption research. First, we characterized IYD ontogeny through quantification of IYD mRNA expression. Under normal development, IYD was expressed in thyroid glands, kidneys, liver, and intestines, but minimally in the tail. Then, we evaluated how IYD inhibition affected developing larval X. laevis with an in vivo exposure to a known IYD inhibitor (3-nitro-l-tyrosine, MNT) under iodine-controlled conditions; MNT concentrations were 7.4-200 mg/L, with an additional 'rescue' treatment of 200 mg/L MNT supplemented with iodide. Chemical inhibition of IYD resulted in markedly delayed development, with larvae in the highest MNT concentrations arrested prior to metamorphic climax. This effect was linked to reduced glandular and circulating thyroid hormones, increased thyroidal sodium-iodide symporter gene expression, and follicular cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Iodide supplementation negated these effects, effectively rescuing exposed larvae. These results establish toxicological relevance of IYD inhibition in amphibians. Given the highly conserved nature of the IYD protein sequence and scarcity of environmental iodine, IYD should be further investigated as a target for thyroid axis disruption in freshwater organisms.",30137636,mheintz,,1,,,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,"3-nitro-l-tyrosine iodide",,,,,,Amphibian,,,,,,Yes_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Larva,Metamorphosis,,,,,,,,NIS,,,,,,,IYD,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,,,NIS_mRNA,,,,,Expression,,,,,,,,,Thyroid_mRNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,T3,T4,,,,,,TG_gross_histopath,,,,,,,,Amphibian_development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we aimed to evaluate the effect of plastic endocrine disruptors on type 1 and type 2 deiodinase activities, enzymes responsible for the conversion of the pro-hormone T4 into the biologically active thyroid hormone T3, both in vitro and in vivo. Initially, we incubated rat liver type 1 deiodinase and brown adipose tissue type 2 deiodinase samples with 0.5 mM of the plasticizers, and the deiodinase activity was measured. Among them, only BPA was capable to inhibit both type 1 and type 2 deiodinases. Then, adult male Wistar rats were treated orally with bisphenol A (40 mg/kg b.w.) for 15 days and hepatic type 1 deiodinase and brown adipose tissue type 2 deiodinase activities and serum thyroid hormone concentrations were measured. In vivo bisphenol A treatment significantly reduced hepatic type 1 deiodinase activity but did not affect brown adipose tissue type 2 deiodinase activity. Serum T4 levels were higher in bisphenol A group, while T3 remained unchanged. T3/T4 ratio was decreased in rats treated with bisphenol A, reinforcing the idea that peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormone was affected by bisphenol A exposure. Therefore, our results suggest that bisphenol A can affect the metabolism of thyroid hormone thus disrupting thyroid signaling.",31174228,wklaren@21centurytoxicology.com,,1,,In_Vitro,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,bisphenol A,Rodent,,,,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,"[JU reviewer note: Q1 - unselected ""ex vivo"", selected ""in vitro"" instead.]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO1,DIO2,,,,DIO_activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Liver_activity,,,,,Other_tissue_activity_source,Brown Adipose,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,T3,T4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An impairment in thyroid hormone action during vertebrate development results in severe, irreversible abnormalities in tissue growth, maturation, and function. The deiodinases are a family of selenoproteins expressed in a number of fetal and adult tissues that catalyze the activation and inactivation of thyroid hormones. Their unique biochemical characteristics and tissue and developmental expression patterns suggest that deiodinases may control the concentration of active thyroid hormone available to specific tissues or cell types at certain stages of development. The deiodinases thus appear to play an important role in regulating thyroid hormone action at a prereceptor level.

C., Larsen, L., Lechan, Bianco, D.",Atypical expression of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase in thyrotrophs explains the thyroxine-mediated pituitary thyrotropin feedback mechanism,"T(4), the main product of thyroid secretion, is a critical signal in plasma that mediates the TSH-negative feedback mechanism. As a prohormone, T(4) must be converted to T(3) to acquire biological activity; thus, type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2) is expected to play a critical role in this feedback mechanism. However, the mechanistic details of this pathway are still missing because, counterintuitively, D2 activity is rapidly lost in the presence of T(4) by a ubiquitin-proteasomal mechanism. In the present study, we demonstrate that D2 and TSH are coexpressed in rat pituitary thyrotrophs and that hypothyroidism increases D2 expression in these cells. Studies using two murine-derived thyrotroph cells, TtT-97 and TalphaT1, demonstrate high expression of D2 in thyrotrophs and confirm its sensitivity to negative regulation by T(4)-induced proteasomal degradation of this enzyme. Despite this, expression of the Dio2 gene in TalphaT1 cells is higher than their T(4)-induced D2 ubiquitinating capacity. As a result, D2 activity and net T(3) production in these cells are sustained, even at free T(4) concentrations that are severalfold above the physiological range. In this system, free T(4) concentrations and net D2-mediated T(3) production correlated negatively with TSHbeta gene expression. These results resolve the apparent paradox between the homeostatic regulation of D2 and its role in mediating the critical mechanism by which T(4) triggers the TSH-negative feedback.",16396983,wklaren@21centurytoxicology.com,,1,,In_Vitro,,,,,,,,,Unclear_Chemical,,Rodent,,,,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,"[JU reviewer note: Q2 - changed from ""no"" to ""unclear"" as the phrase ""T4-induced"" is used a few times and suggests T4 may have been added to in vitro system.

In this study we analyzed NIS expression and function in the human JAr placental choriocarcinoma cell line. Using real-time quantitative RT-PCR, we first demonstrated that NIS transcripts are expressed at a high level in JAr cells compared with other cell lines, including thyroid cancer cells. Functional analysis clearly showed that Jar cells are able to concentrate iodide in presence of hCG. Iodide accumulation increased after 2-h exposure to 5 IU/ml hCG, to 6-fold over the basal level after 8 h. This effect was reproduced using forskolin, the cAMP analog (Bu)(2)-cAMP, and phorbol acetate. Moreover, hCG increased both NIS mRNA after 2 h and NIS protein levels after 4 h, reaching a maximum after 8 h in both cases. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that 1) NIS is expressed in JAr cells; 2) iodide transport in JAr cells is regulated by hCG and by cAMP-dependent and -independent mechanisms; 3) the stimulation of iodide uptake is due to an increase in both NIS mRNA and protein levels; and 4) JAr cells may represent an excellent in vitro model suitable to analyze the molecular mechanisms involved in iodide transport from mother to fetus.",12021185,wklaren@21centurytoxicology.com,,1,,In_Vitro,,,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,"hCG forskolin (Bu)(2)-cAMP phorbol acetate",,Human,,,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,"[JU reviewer note: Q5 - changed selection from ""yes"" to ""no""; the cell line used is a placental tumor line, no mention of differentiation, etc., and mother and fetus are mentioned in discussion but not part of study design, per se.]",,NIS_mRNA,NIS_protein,NIS_activity,,,Expression,,,,,PCR,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_cell_mRNA_source,human JAr placental choriocarcinoma cell line,Protein_level,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_cell_protein_source,human JAr placental choriocarcinoma cell line,,,,Other_activity_method,iodide accumulation,,,,,,,,,,Other_cell_activity_source,human JAr placental choriocarcinoma cell line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these, monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) is mutated in Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, a severe mental retardation associated with abnormal thyroid hormone constellations. Since mice deficient in Mct8 exhibit a milder neurological phenotype than patients, we hypothesized that alternative thyroid hormone transporters may compensate in murine brain cells for the lack of Mct8. Using qPCR, Western Blot, and immunocytochemistry, we investigated the expression of three different thyroid hormone transporters, i.e., Mct8 and L-type amino acid transporters Lat1 and Lat2, in mouse brain. All three thyroid hormone transporters are expressed from corticogenesis and peak around birth. Primary cultures of neurons and astrocytes express Mct8, Lat1, and Lat2. Microglia specifically expresses Mct10 and Slco4a1 in addition to high levels of Lat2 mRNA and protein. As in vivo, a brain microvascular endothelial cell line expressed Mct8 and Lat1. 158N, an oligodendroglial cell line expressed Mct8 protein, consistent with delayed myelination in MCT8-deficient patients. Functional T(3)- and T(4)-transport assays into primary astrocytes showed K(M) values of 4.2 and 3.7 μM for T(3) and T(4). Pharmacological inhibition of L-type amino acid transporters by BCH and genetic inactivation of Lat2 reduced astrocytic T(3) uptake to the same extent.

All these pure phytochemical substances exhibited different modes of TPO inhibition. Rutin and rosmarinic acid showed competitive, quercetin-uncompetitive and chlorogenic acid-noncompetitive inhibition effect on TPO. Homology modeling was used to gain insight into the 3D structure of TPO and molecular docking was applied to study the interactions of the inhibitors with their target at the molecular level. Moreover, the type and strength of mutual interactions between the inhibitors (expressed as the combination index, CI) were analyzed. Slight synergism, antagonism, and moderate antagonism were found in the case of the combined addition of the pure polyphenols. Rutin and quercetin as well as rutin and rosmarinic acid acted additively (CI = 0.096 and 1.06, respectively), while rutin and chlorogenic acid demonstrated slight synergism (CI = 0.88) and rosmarinic acid with quercetin and rosmarinic acid with chlorogenic acid showed moderate antagonism (CI = 1.45 and 1.25, respectively).

R., Carrano, M., Di Stasi, V., Volpe, A., Murino, A., Izzo, G., Vitale, M.",Prevalence of Dio2(T92A) polymorphism and its association with thyroid autoimmunity,"The 3,5,3'-L-triiodothyronine (T₃) partly derives by the deiodination of the prohormone 3,5,3',5'-L-tetraiodothyronine (T₄) by the type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2). The single-nucleotide polymorphism in the D2 gene at position 92 (Dio(2T92A)), generates an enzyme with a reduced T₄ to T₃ conversion velocity. Because thyroid hormones can modulate the immune response, we hypothesized a pathophysiological role for Dio(2T92A) polymorphism in autoimmunity. The objective of this study was to investigate the Dio(2T92A) polymorphism in relation to thyroid autoimmunity (TA). We compared the prevalence of Dio(2T92A) polymorphism and serum thyroid hormone levels in healthy subjects and subjects with TA. A total of 110 subjects with TA and 106 controls were genotypized for Dio(2T92A) polymorphism. Free T₃ (FT₃), free T₄ (FT₄) and TSH were measured and compared with the Dio(2T92A) polymorphism. Dio(292T/A), Dio(292A/A), and Dio(292T/T) healthy subjects were 40.9%, 46.4%, and 12.7%, respectively. These prevalences were similar to those of some European countries whilst significantly different from that of Brazil. In the two groups of healthy subjects and TA subjects, Dio(2T92A) polymorphism had a similar distribution with non-significant differences. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in the serum concentration of FT₃, FT₄, and TSH between subjects with different Dio(2T92A) polymorphism. The FT₄/FT₃, and TSH/FT₃ ratios were higher in Dio(292T/T) than in Dio(292T/A) and Dio(292A/A) subjects in both TA and healthy groups, but these differences were not significant.

It has been suggested that these subjects show both diminished concentration of TBG and reduced TBG affinity for T4 (Sarne et al., 1985). We have compared 12 euthyroid aborigines with low T4 (total T4 44 +/- 5 nmol/l) and aborigines with normal T4 (T4 99 +/- 9 nmol/l, n = 12) using measurements of free T4 and T3 by equilibrium dialysis. TBG was measured both by RIA (Henning, Berlin, FRG) and a method dependent on T4 binding (Corning Immophase). Aborigines with low T4 showed lower levels of free T4 (12.6 +/- 0.6 cf. 18.7 +/- 1.0 pM), free T4 index (66 +/- 8 cf. 98 +/- 13), total T3 (1.1 +/- 0.2 cf. 1.6 +/- 0.3 nmol/l), TBG RIA (14.0 +/- 0.6 cf. 25.0 +/- 1.2 ng/l), and TBG Immophase (9.0 +/- 0.5 cf. 22.0 +/- 1.2 mg/l) (P less than 0.01), but free T3 (5.3 +/- 0.4 cf. 4.7 +/- 0.4 pM) and TSH (1.9 +/- 0.2 cf. 1.8 +/- 0.2 mU/l) were not significantly different from the values found in aborigines with normal T4. Scatchard analysis of T4 and T3 binding was performed using serum diluted 1 : 20,000 for T4 and 1 : 500 for T3 (barbitone buffer pH 8.6, 4 degrees C, dextran-coated charcoal separation). In euthyroid low T4 aborigines compared to those with normal T4, both T4 capacity (106 +/- 14 cf. 238 +/- 13 nM, P less than 0.01) and affinity (5.05 X 10(10) cf. 8.47 X 10(10) M-1, P less than 0.05) were significantly reduced. Similarly, both T3 capacity (62 +/- 10 cf. 154 +/- 16 nM, P less than 0.01) and affinity (1.67 X 10(9) cf. 2.28 X 10(9) M-1, P less than 0.02) were reduced.

The response to different mitogens (TSH acting through cAMP, EGF and TPA) has been compared. TPO mRNA accumulation was exquisitely dependent on a continuous TSH/cAMP stimulation. It was induced within 1 h in the whole cell population from a very low basal level. This effect was inhibited by the cAMP-independent mitogens EGF and TPA. By contrast, the TSH-induction of TPO mRNA accumulation was observed irrespectively of the proliferative activity of the cells, i.e. in the presence or the absence of insulin, which is required for mitogenesis. The short half-life of TPO mRNA (+/- 2 h) implies that it was continuously transcribed during TSH/cAMP-dependent cell cycling. As compared to another thyroid differentiation marker, thyroglobulin mRNA (Pohl et al., J. Cell Biol. 111, 663-672 (1990)), TPO mRNA accumulation differed by the rapidity of its control by cAMP, the pattern of its intercellular heterogeneity, and the unexpected segregation to a perinuclear region, probably the nuclear envelope that constitutes a specialized part of the endoplasmic reticulum. Despite these differences, both TPO and thyroglobulin gene transcriptions are unequivocally compatible with the cell cycle when induced by cAMP, at variance with the generally observed antagonism between growth and differentiation expression.",8269983,mheintz,,1,,In_Vitro,,,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,"insulin TSH EGF TPA",,,Other_Mammal,dog,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TPO,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,[JU reviewer note: Q3 - added EGF and TPA.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TPO_mRNA,,,,,Expression,,,ISH,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_cell_mRNA_source,primary thyroid epithelial cells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Thyroglobulin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,response to mitogens,"The response to different mitogens (TSH acting through cAMP, EGF and TPA) has been compared.",

In mice, deletion of Mct8 (Mct8 KO) faithfully replicates AHDS-associated endocrine abnormalities; however, unlike patients, these animals do not exhibit neurological impairments. While transport of the active form of TH (T3) across the blood-brain barrier is strongly diminished in Mct8 KO animals, prohormone (T4) can still enter the brain, possibly due to the presence of T4-selective organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1C1). Here, we characterized mice deficient for both TH transporters, MCT8 and OATP1C1 (Mct8/Oatp1c1 DKO). Mct8/Oatp1c1 DKO mice exhibited alterations in peripheral TH homeostasis that were similar to those in Mct8 KO mice; however, uptake of both T3 and T4 into the brains of Mct8/Oatp1c1 DKO mice was strongly reduced. Evidence of TH deprivation in the CNS of Mct8/Oatp1c1 DKO mice included highly decreased brain TH content as well as altered deiodinase activities and TH target gene expression. Consistent with delayed cerebellar development and reduced myelination, Mct8/Oatp1c1 DKO mice displayed pronounced locomotor abnormalities. Intriguingly, differentiation of GABAergic interneurons in the cerebral cortex was highly compromised. Our findings underscore the importance of TH transporters for proper brain development and provide a basis to study the pathogenic mechanisms underlying AHDS.",24691440,gchappell@toxstrategies.com,,1,,,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,No_Chemical,,Rodent,,,,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mem_Transporters,DIO,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,did NOT select cross-talk for the double knock-out (PD referenced),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO_activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MCT8,,OATP1C1,,,,,,,,,,MT_activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,T3_T4_uptake_efflux,,,,Brain_activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Genetic_model_type,Mct8/Oatp1c1 DKO,,,,,,,T3,T4,,,,,,,,,Brain,,,,Cognitive_behavioral,,,,,,,,,Gene_expression,,,,,,,,,

In this study we analyzed NIS expression and function in the human JAr placental choriocarcinoma cell line. Using real-time quantitative RT-PCR, we first demonstrated that NIS transcripts are expressed at a high level in JAr cells compared with other cell lines, including thyroid cancer cells. Functional analysis clearly showed that Jar cells are able to concentrate iodide in presence of hCG. Iodide accumulation increased after 2-h exposure to 5 IU/ml hCG, to 6-fold over the basal level after 8 h. This effect was reproduced using forskolin, the cAMP analog (Bu)(2)-cAMP, and phorbol acetate. Moreover, hCG increased both NIS mRNA after 2 h and NIS protein levels after 4 h, reaching a maximum after 8 h in both cases. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that 1) NIS is expressed in JAr cells; 2) iodide transport in JAr cells is regulated by hCG and by cAMP-dependent and -independent mechanisms; 3) the stimulation of iodide uptake is due to an increase in both NIS mRNA and protein levels; and 4) JAr cells may represent an excellent in vitro model suitable to analyze the molecular mechanisms involved in iodide transport from mother to fetus.",12021185,gchappell@toxstrategies.com,,1,,In_Vitro,,,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,"hCG forskolin (Bu)(2)-cAMP phorbol acetate",,Human,,,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,,,NIS_mRNA,NIS_protein,NIS_activity,,,Expression,,,,,PCR,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_cell_mRNA_source,JAr placental choriocarcinoma cell line | thyroid cancer cells,Protein_level,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_cell_protein_source,JAr placental choriocarcinoma cell line,,,,Other_activity_method,Iodide uptake,,,,,,,,,,Other_cell_activity_source,JAr placental choriocarcinoma cell line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

M.","Activation of the thyroid peroxidase gene in human thyroid cells: Effect of thyrotrophin, forskolin and phorbol ester","The enzyme thyroid peroxidase (TPO) plays a central role in thyroid hormone synthesis and is the target for the autoimmune attack in lymphocytic thyroiditis. We have examined the activation of the TPO gene in cultured human thyrocytes using slot-blot hybridization with a synthetic 40 mer oligonucleotide probe derived from the nucleotide sequence of the human TPO gene. The oligonucleotide probe was shown by Northern blotting to hybridize specifically to an approximately 3 kb RNA species from thyroid tissue of patients with Graves' disease, but not to RNA preparations from human or bovine retinal tissue, providing compelling evidence for the specificity of the probe for TPO mRNA. Addition of TSH (10 mU/ml) to primary thyroid cultures for 4 h led to increased TPO mRNA levels which were maximal after 48 h and significantly higher than basal even after 7 days of co-culture. Activation of TPO mRNA by TSH showed dose dependency over a wide range (0.01-100 mU/ml), with a maximal effect at 10 mU TSH/ml in cells cultured for a period of 72 h. Comparison of TPO mRNA levels with the accumulation of thyroglobulin mRNA levels following stimulation by TSH indicated that the induction of the gene encoding thyroglobulin precedes transcription of the TPO gene. The adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (1-100 microM) mimicked TSH in increasing TPO mRNA levels whilst, in contrast, the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA; 0.01-1 microM) led to levels of TPO mRNA that were lower than basal. Thus TSH induces a specific dose-dependent activation of TPO mRNA which is mimicked by agents which increase cyclic AMP. In contrast, TPA-induced activation of protein kinase C inhibits this response.",2742742,mheintz,,1,,In_Vitro,,,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,"TSH forskolin 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate",,Human,Other_Mammal,bovine,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TPO,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,"[JU reviewer note: added ""other mammal - bovine"" to the species list.]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TPO_mRNA,,,,,Expression,,,,,Northern,,,,,,,,,,,Other_cell_mRNA_source,human thyrocytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Thyroglobulin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The endostyle, one of the characteristic organs of ascidians, is a pharyngeal structure with iodine-concentrating and peroxidase activities and is therefore considered to be homologous to the follicular thyroid of higher vertebrates. We have previously reported that a limited part of the endostyle (zone VII) is marked by the expression of orthologs of the thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroid transcription factor-2 (TTF-2/FoxE) genes. In this study, we have identified the Ciona homolog of NADPH oxidase/peroxidase (Duox), which provides hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) for iodine metabolism by TPO in the vertebrate thyroid. Expression patterns assessed by in situ hybridization have revealed that Ciona Duox (Ci-Duox) is predominantly expressed in the dorsal part of zone VII of the endostyle. Furthermore, two-color fluorescent in situ hybridization with Ci-Duox and Ciona TPO (CiTPO) has revealed that the ventral boundary of the Ci-Duox domain of expression is more dorsal than that of CiTPO. We have also characterized several genes, such as Ci-Fgf8/17/18, 5HT7, and Ci-NK4, which are predominantly expressed in the ventral part of zone VII, in a region complementary to the Ci-Duox expression domain.

To address this issue, a new cell line, designated brown fat vascular-stromal (BVS-1), was generated by continuous subculturing of precursor cells derived from the vascular-stromal fraction of rat neonatal brown fat. BVS-1 cells did not differentiate into adipocytes when cultured for 5 d in DMEM supplemented with 2% newborn calf serum, 4 nM insulin, 2 nM T(3), and 10 nM dexamethasone (DEX). However, when cultured in regular medium, the cells expressed high levels of D3 activity (1-5 pmol/h per milligram protein) and mRNA. D3 mRNA was markedly induced by treatment for 6 h with epidermal growth factor, acid or basic fibroblast growth factors (10 ng/ml), or a 3-h treatment with a phorbol ester [12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), 1 microM] or 10% fetal bovine serum. However, preincubation of cells overnight with 50 nM DEX completely blocked the D3-inducing effects of basic fibroblast growth factor. The DEX effect was partially blocked when a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist was present. Overnight DEX treatment (50 nM) also decreased basal D3 activity by 80%. In summary, we have established BVS-1 cells as a continuous cell line useful for studying the regulation of D3 expression. Furthermore, we have shown that DEX inhibits growth factor-induced D3 expression in these cells.",12072398,wklaren@21centurytoxicology.com,,1,,In_Vitro,,,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,"epidermal growth factor acid or basic fibroblast growth factors 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) fetal bovine serum dexamethasone (DEX)",Rodent,,,,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO3,DIO_mRNA,,DIO_activity,,Expression,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_cell_mRNA_source,BVS-1 cells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_cell_activity_source,BVS-1 cells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we examined the regulation of the D2 pathway in primary skeletal muscle myoblasts taken from both humans and mice. We found that pioglitazone treatment led to a 1.6- to 1.9-fold increase in primary human skeletal myocyte D2 activity; this effect was seen with other peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonists. D2 activity in primary murine skeletal myotubes increased 2.8-fold in response to 5 microM pioglitazone and 1.6-fold in response to 5 nM insulin and increased in a dose-dependent manner in response to lithocholic acid (maximum response at 25 microM was approximately 3.8-fold). We compared Akt phosphorylation in primary myotubes derived from wild-type and D2 knockout (D2KO) mice: phospho-Akt was reduced by 50% in the D2KO muscle after 1 nM insulin exposure. Expression of T(3)-responsive muscle genes via quantitative RT-PCR suggests that D2KO cells have decreased thyroid hormone signaling, which could contribute to the abnormalities in insulin signaling. D2 activity in skeletal muscle fragments from both murine and human sources was low, on the order of about 0.01 fmol/min . mg of muscle protein. The phenotypic changes seen with D2KO cells support a metabolic role for D2 in muscle, hinting at a D2-mediated linkage between thyroid hormone and insulin signaling, but the low activity calls into question whether skeletal muscle D2 is a major source of plasma T(3).",19036883,gchappell@toxstrategies.com,,1,,In_Vitro,,,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,"pioglitazone insulin lithocholic acid",Rodent,Human,,,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,Other_biological_events,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO2,,,,DIO_activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_cell_activity_source,primary murine skeletal myotubes | skeletal muscle fragments,Genetic_model_type,D2 knockout,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Gene_expression,,,,,,,,,

We used in silico predictions from vertebrate deiodinase sequences to identify two domains: the N-terminal variable region (VR) containing the transmembrane, hinge and linker domains, and the conserved or globular region (CR). Given the high sequence and structural identity of the CR among paralogs as well as of the VR among orthologs but not paralogs, we hypothesized that both the catalytic properties and the subcellular localization rely on the VR. We used shark D2 and D3 as templates to build the chimeric enzymes D2VR/D3CR and D3VR/D2CR. Biochemical characterization revealed that D3VR/D2CR has inner-ring deiodination activity and T3 as preferred substrate, whereas D2VR/D3CR showed no deiodinating activity. Also, D2VR/D3CR and D3VR/D2CR reside in the endoplasmic reticulum and plasmatic membrane, respectively, as do their D2 and D3 wild-type counterparts.

The predominant deiodinase expressed in placenta was type III (D3); type II (D2) was also present. In general terms, the activities of the enzymes D2 and D3 (and mRNAs encoding these enzymes) were higher earlier in gestation (<28 wk) than at term and displayed an inverse relationship with the duration of gestation (P < 0.05). Comparison of the relative expressions of mRNAs encoding D2 and D3 as well as their activities in placentas associated with IUGR (early and late gestational groups) with findings from normal placentas of similar gestational ages revealed no significant differences. Immunolocalization of D2 and D3 in syncytiotrophoblast (including syncytial sprouts) and cytotrophoblast of human placentas was demonstrated at both early and late gestation. Treatment of primary cultures of term cytotrophoblast cells in vitro with increasing doses of T(3) (1, 10, and 100 nM) resulted in increased expression of mRNAs encoding both D2 and D3 at 100-nM concentrations (P < 0.01) compared with control. Experiments with JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells demonstrated a similar effect on D3 mRNA at 10 and 100 nM T(3) (P < 0.01). The demonstrated changes in iodothyronine deiodinase expression in the placenta across pregnancy are likely to contribute to regulation of the thyroid hormone supply to the developing fetus.

To exert its biological activity, T(4) needs to be converted to T(3) by iodothyronine deiodinase.

In the present study we investigated the possible expression and function of iodothyronine deiodinase and TSH receptors in human osteoblast-like osteosarcoma (SaOS-2) cells and normal human osteoblast (NHOst) cells. Iodothyronine deiodinase activity was detected in SaOS-2 cells and NHOst cells, and all of the characteristics of deiodinating activity were compatible with those of D2.

In addition, all T(3) receptor isoforms were detected by RT-PCR in SaOS-2 cells and NHOst cells.

In the present study we used thyroid histoautoradiography, an indirect assay of in vivo TPO activity, to determine the possible parallelism between the in vitro and in vivo changes induced by experimental DM. DM was induced in male Wistar rats (about 250 g body weight) by a single i.p. streptozotocin injection (45 mg/kg), while control (C) animals received a single injection of the vehicle. Seven and 30 days after diabetes induction, each diabetic and control animal was given i.p. a tracer dose of 125I (2 microCi), 2.5 h before thyroid excision. The glands were counted, weighted, fixed in Bouin's solution, embedded in paraffin and cut. The sections were stained with HE and exposed to NTB-2 emulsion (Kodak). The autohistograms were developed and the quantitative distribution of silver grains was evaluated with a computerized image analyzer system. Thyroid radioiodine uptake was significantly decreased only after 30 days of DM (C: 0.38 +/- 0.05 vs DM: 0.20 +/- 0.04%/mg thyroid, P < 0.05) while in vivo TPO activity was significantly decreased 7 and 30 days after DM induction (C: 5.3 and 4.5 grains/100 micron 2 vs DM: 2.9 and 1.6 grains/100 micron 2, respectively, P < 0.05).

This organ is also considered to be homologous to the follicular thyroid gland of higher vertebrates. Thyroglobulin (Tg) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) are specifically expressed in the thyroid gland of higher vertebrates, and they play an important role in iodine metabolism for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Previous histochemical observations showed that iodine-concentrating and peroxidase activities were detected in zones 7, 8, and 9 of the ascidian endostyle, suggesting that these zones contains cells that are equivalent to those in the vertebrate follicular thyroid. In order to investigate the molecular developmental mechanisms involved in the formation and function of the endostyle, with special reference to the evolution of the thyroid gland, in the present study, we isolated and characterized cDNA clones for TPO genes, CiTPO from Ciona intestinalis and HrTPO from Halocynthia roretzi. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses revealed that the expression of the ascidian TPO genes was restricted to zone 7, one of the elements equivalent to the thyroid.

Similarly, the effects of NGT on transcripts of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (Trh), Dio1, iodothyronine deiodinase type II (Dio2) and thyroid hormone receptor α (Thra) genes were generally low. In addition, NGT resulted in some alterations of Tg and Thrb transcripts at different time points. However, a strong induction of Nis mRNA by P4 and NGT was observed in zebrafish embryos-larvae.

In untreated cells, D3 messenger RNA (mRNA) was essentially undetectable by Northern analysis and RT-PCR. However, all four agents induced expression of a 2.4-kb D3 transcript as well as D3 activity.

We examined the activity of the different deiodinases in human cell lines and investigated the regulation of D3 activity and mRNA expression in these cell lines, as well as its possible coexpression with neighboring genes Dlk1 and Dio3os, which may also be especially important during development. D1 activity and mRNA were only found in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells, and D2 activity was observed in none of the cell lines. D3 activity and mRNA was found in ECC-1 endometrium carcinoma cells, MCF-7 mammacarcinoma cells, WRL-68 embryonic liver cells, and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, but not in the HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cell line or in any choriocarcinoma or astrocytoma cell line. We demonstrated that the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate increased D3 activity 2- to 9-fold in ECC-1, MCF-7, WRL-68, and SH-SY5Y cells. Estradiol increased D3 activity 3-fold in ECC-1, but not in any other cells. Dexamethasone decreased D3 activity in WRL-68 cells only in the absence of fetal calf serum. Incubation with retinoids increased D3 activity 2- to 3-fold in ECC-1, WRL-68, and MCF-7 cells but decreased D3 activity in SH-SY5Y cells. D3 expression in the different cells was not affected by cAMP or thyroid hormone. Interestingly, D3 mRNA expression in the different cell lines strongly correlated with Dio3os mRNA expression and in a large set of neuroblastoma cell lines also with Dlk1 expression. In conclusion, we identified different human D3-expressing cell lines, in which the regulation of D3 expression is cell type-specific. Our data suggest that estradiol may be one of the factors contributing to the induction of D3 activity in the pregnant uterus and that in addition to gene-specific regulatory elements, more distant common regulatory elements also may be involved in the regulation of D3 expression.",16935842,wklaren@21centurytoxicology.com,,1,,In_Vitro,,,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,"12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate Estradiol Dexamethasone retinoids cAMP thyroid hormone",,Human,,,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO1,DIO2,DIO3,DIO_mRNA,,DIO_activity,,Expression,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_cell_mRNA_source,HepG2|ECC-1||MCF-7|WRL-68|SH-SY5Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_cell_activity_source,HepG2|ECC-1||MCF-7|WRL-68|SH-SY5Y,,,Other_models_used,"choriocarcinoma or astrocytoma cell lines also examined, but no DIO expression or activity was observed.",,,[JU reviewer note: Q15 - added model note.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Gene_expression,,,,,"[JU reviewer note: Q3 - unselected ""p-p interactions"" (Dlk1&Dio3os) and selected ""thyroid gene expression"".]",,,,

Turtles exposed to low ambient temperature (10 degrees C for 15 days) showed a significant decrease in relative thyroid weight, follicular cell size (cell became squamous from cuboidal type) and epithelial height in both the peripheral and central follicles of the gland, with the appearance of homogeneous colloid materials in the follicular lumen. Thyroid peroxidase activity declined significantly. In contrast, high ambient temperatures (32/34 degrees C for 15 days) caused reverse changes to those observed after exposure with low ambient temperature. No significant difference was marked in thyroid activity between 32 and 34 degrees C temperature treatments. The findings provide evidence that low ambient temperature inhibits thyroid activity and high ambient temperature stimulates the gland activity in soft-shelled turtles. Ambient temperature acts presumably via the hypothalamo-hypophysial (TRF-TSH) axis which in turn alters thyroid function in turtles.",16229156,gchappell@toxstrategies.com,,1,,,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,No_Chemical,,,,,,,,,Reptile,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TPO,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TPO_activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Thyroid_activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TG_weight_size,TG_gross_histopath,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the frequency and pattern of TPO abnormalities, we have been screening TPO genes of patients with congenital goitrous hypothyroidism. Subjects and methods: TPO genes of a patient with congenital goitrous hypothyroidism and her parents were directly sequenced, and two novel missense mutations (R665W and G771R) were found. The former was derived from her father and the latter from her mother. R665 and G771 were well conserved in the peroxidase superfamily. When mRNAs containing each of the mutations were transfected into CHO-K1 cells, each cell showed faint TPO enzyme activity. However, immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopic analyses revealed that neither of the mutated TPOs reached the plasma membrane. Conclusions: Two novel missense mutations in the TPO gene were found. TPO proteins encoded by these mutated alleles showed abnormal cellular localization; namely, localization on the plasma membrane was disturbed. The loss of plasma membrane localization in mutated TPOs brought about the iodide organification defect, which was diagnosed as congenital hypothyroidism.",11916616,gchappell@toxstrategies.com,,1,,In_Vitro,,,Clinical_Descriptive,,,,,,No_Chemical,,Rodent,Human,,,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TPO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TPO_mRNA,TPO_protein,TPO_activity,,Sequence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Protein_distribution,,,,,,,Immunofluorescence,Other_protein_method,immunoelectron microscopic analyses,,,,,,,,,Other_cell_protein_source,CHO-K1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_cell_activity_source,CHO-K1,,,,,,,,,,,Other_models_used,TPO with missense mutations transfected into CHO-K1 cells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6969548,"Sugawara, M., Hagen, G. A.",Thyroid hormone formation catalyzed by human thyroid peroxidase: a new and physiological measurement of thyroid peroxidase,"This report describes a method for measurement of TPO activity by the amount of thyroid hormone production. Thyroid hormone formation was accomplished by incubating purified iodine-poor Tg with human TPO for 60 min at 37 C in the presence of free DIT, KI, and an H2O2 source. Newly formed T3 and T4 were measured by radioimmunoassay of the Tg hydrolysates. With this method, TPO-catalyzed iodination of Tg and thyroid hormone formation were measured simultaneously from eight normal thyroid glands and 15 thyroid glands from MMI-treated patients with Graves' disease. Graves' disease TPO showed iodinating activity and T4 formation which was higher than that of TPO from normal thyroids, and there was a positive linear correlation between the iodinating activity and the amount of T4 formation. T3 production by highly active TPO, however, dissociates from the amount of T4 formation and the degree of Tg iodination. Thus, if the activity of TPO is to be measured by the amount of thyroid hormone production, T4 should be used rather than T3. The method of thyroid hormone formation described here provides a new and physiological measurement of TPO activity and should be useful for investigation of the role of human TPO in thyroid hormone formation.",6895910,wklaren@21centurytoxicology.com,,1,,,,,Clinical_Descriptive,,,,,,No_Chemical,,,Human,,,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TPO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,"[JU reviewer note: Q1 - unselected ""in vitro"" as assay was used in epi-descriptive design.]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TPO_activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_activity_method,radioimmunoassay of the Tg hydrolysates (Novel Method),Thyroid_activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[JU reviewer note: Q10 - added more detail to description of ""other"" method.]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serum T3 was just slightly decreased in the senescent rats. Total pituitary DI activity was significantly decreased in the aged rats (10-12 and 24-30 months). Both type I and type II DI activities were affected, although the decrease in type I DI only became significant in the senescent rats.

Among the factors potentially affecting perinatal exposure of tissues to THs is type 3 deiodinase (D3). This enzyme degrades THs and is highly expressed in the pregnant uterus, placenta, and fetal and neonatal tissues. To determine the physiological role of D3, we have generated a mouse D3 knockout model (D3KO) by a targeted inactivating mutation of the Dio3 gene in mouse ES cells. Early in life, D3KO mice exhibit delayed 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) clearance, a markedly elevated serum T3 level, and overexpression of T3-inducible genes in the brain. From postnatal day 15 to adulthood, D3KO mice demonstrate central hypothyroidism, with low serum levels of 3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyronine (T4) and T3, and modest or no increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration. Peripheral tissues are also hypothyroid. Hypothalamic T3 content is decreased while thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) expression is elevated. Our results demonstrate that the lack of D3 function results in neonatal thyrotoxicosis followed later by central hypothyroidism that persists throughout life. These mice provide a new model of central hypothyroidism and reveal a critical role for D3 in the maturation and function of the thyroid axis.",16410833,gchappell@toxstrategies.com,,1,,,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,No_Chemical,,Rodent,,,,,,,,,,,Yes_LifeStage,,,,Postnatal,Neonatal,,,,,,,,,Adult,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Genetic_model_type,D3KO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,T3,T4,TSH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Gene_expression,,,,,,,thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH),thyrotropin releasing hormone expression is elevated,

A.",Targeted disruption of the type 1 selenodeiodinase gene (Dio1) results in marked changes in thyroid hormone economy in mice,"The type 1 deiodinase (D1) is thought to be an important source of T3 in the euthyroid state. To explore the role of the D1 in thyroid hormone economy, a D1-deficient mouse (D1KO) was made by targeted disruption of the Dio1 gene. The general health and reproductive capacity of the D1KO mouse were seemingly unimpaired. In serum, levels of T4 and rT3 were elevated, whereas those of TSH and T3 were unchanged, as were several indices of peripheral thyroid status. It thus appears that the D1 is not essential for the maintenance of a normal serum T3 level in euthyroid mice. However, D1 deficiency resulted in marked changes in the metabolism and excretion of iodothyronines. Fecal excretion of endogenous iodothyronines was greatly increased. Furthermore, when compared with both wild-type and D2-deficient mice, fecal excretion of [125I]iodothyronines was greatly increased in D1KO mice during the 48 h after injection of [125I]T4 or [125I]T3, whereas urinary excretion of [125I]iodide was markedly diminished. From these data it was estimated that a majority of the iodide generated by the D1 was derived from substrates other than T4. Treatment with T3 resulted in a significantly higher serum T3 level and a greater degree of hyperthyroidism in D1KO mice than in wild-type mice. We conclude that, although the D1 is of questionable importance to the wellbeing of the euthyroid mouse, it may play a major role in limiting the detrimental effects of conditions that alter normal thyroid function, including hyperthyroidism and iodine deficiency.",16223863,wklaren@21centurytoxicology.com,,1,,,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,T3,Rodent,,,,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,TH_ADME_PBPK,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,"[JU reviewer note: Q2-3 - Changed answer to ""yes"" and added T3 to chem list.]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO1,DIO2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Genetic_model_type,D1-deficient mouse (D1KO),,,,,"[JU reviewer note: Q1  was blank, selected D1 and D2 since KOs of both were studied.]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,T3,T4,TSH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[JU reviewer note: Q4 - deleted ""iodothyronines ADME"" since this is already captured on basic inventory (TH ADME/PBPK).]",,Iodine ADME,,

L.",Fasting-induced increase in type II iodothyronine deiodinase activity and messenger ribonucleic acid levels is not reversed by thyroxine in the rat hypothalamus,"The importance of local formation of T3 in the feedback effect of the thyroid gland on hypothalamic TRH-producing cells has been established. Primary failure of the thyroid gland results in a fall in circulating T4 and T3 levels, leading to an elevation in the production and release of TRH in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. In contrast, during short term fasting, declining plasma levels of thyroid hormones coincide with suppressed TRH production and release. In the brain, the prevalent enzyme that converts T4 to T3 is type II iodothyronine deiodinase (DII). The present study was undertaken to determine whether a differential hypothalamic expression of type II deiodinase may exist in fasted rats and in animals that are hypothyroid due to the failure of the thyroid gland. Using in situ hybridization, we assessed type II deiodinase messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in the hypothalamus of rats that were control euthyroid, hyperthyroid (T4), hypothyroid induced by propylthiouracil (PTU), and fasted. A group of fasted rats also received exogenous T4. DII mRNA was detected around the third ventricle, including the ependymal layer and adjacent periventricular regions as well as in the arcuate nucleus and the external layer of the median eminence. Quantitative in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that PTU treatment and short term fasting resulted in significant elevations in DII messenger levels compared with those in euthyroid controls. Three weeks of PTU administration induced a consistent decline in circulating T3 and undetectable T4 levels, whereas 3 days of fasting resulted in only a 50% fall in the concentration of serum thyroid hormones. Interestingly, however, the expression of the DII mRNA was more than 2-fold higher in fasted animals compared with the values in PTU-treated rats. Furthermore, although T4 administration repressed DII mRNA expression in euthyroid animals, the same treatment had no effect on the fasting-induced elevations of DII message. To assess whether DII enzymatic activity is also affected during food deprivation, hypothalami were dissected out, and DII activity was measured in control euthyroid, fasted, and fasted plus T4-treated rats. To determine whether comparable changes in plasma thyroid hormone levels induced by fasting and PTU treatment could have affected DII enzymatic activity in a similar manner, animals were injected ip with PTU for 5 days to decrease plasma thyroid hormones to levels similar to those caused by fasting. DII enzymatic assay showed a significant increase in DII activity in fasted and fasted plus T4-treated animals compared with those in euthyroid controls and PTU-treated rats. No significant changes were found in PTU-treated rats compared with euthyroid animals. These data indicate that during short term fasting, a signal of nonthyroid origin underlies the robust elevation of DII production and activity in the hypothalamus. Thus, we propose that during the initial phase of food deprivation, an increased negative thyroid feedback exists on the hypothalamus due to locally formed T3. This local hyperthyroidism may, in turn, induce the suppression of TRH under these conditions.",9607797,jurban@toxstrategies.com,,1,,,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,Yes_Chemical,"T4PTU",Rodent,,,,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO2,,DIO_mRNA,,DIO_activity,,Expression,,,,ISH,,,,,,,Brain_mRNA,hypothalamus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Brain_activity,hypothalamus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_models_used,euthyroid | hyperthyroid (T4) | hypothyroid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,T3,T4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in the RPE65 gene, which encodes the retinal pigment epithelium-specific isomerohydrolase RPE65, account for 16% of all LCA cases. Recent findings have linked cone photoreceptor viability to thyroid hormone (TH) signaling. TH signaling regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism. At the cellular level, TH action is regulated by the two iodothyronine deiodinases, DIO2 and DIO3. DIO2 converts the prohormone thyroxine (T4) to the bioactive hormone triiodothyronine (T3), and DIO3 inactivates T3 and T4. The present work investigates the effects of overexpression of DIO3 to suppress TH signaling and thereby modulate cone death/survival.

Although epidemiologic studies suggest the contribution of TH to the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), the role of DIO2 in CRC remains elusive. Here we show that Dio2 is highly expressed in intestinal polyps of ApcΔ716 mice, a mouse model of familial adenomatous polyposis and early stage sporadic CRC.

Dio2 expression in ApcΔ716 polyps is strongly suppressed by treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor meloxicam. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data shows upregulation of DIO2 in CRC clinical samples and a close association of its expression pattern with the stromal component, consistently with almost exclusive expression of DIO2 in the stroma of human CRC as revealed by in situ hybridization.

R.",Adult mice lacking the type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase have increased subchondral bone but normal articular cartilage,"Background: Although osteoarthritis (OA) is the commonest joint disorder and has a rising prevalence as the population ages, no drugs are available that prevent or delay the onset and progression of disease. Recent studies identified the DIO2 gene encoding type 2 deiodinase (D2) as a susceptibility locus for OA, and further data suggest deiodinase-regulated local availability of triiodothyronine (T3) in the joint plays an important role in cartilage maintenance and repair. To investigate the hypothesis that reduced tissue T3 availability protects joints from development of OA, the joint phenotypes of adult mice lacking D2 (D2KO) or lacking both D1 and D2 (D1D2KO), the only enzymes that catalyze conversion of the prohormone thyroxine to active T3, were determined. Methods: Knee joints were prepared from male 16-week-old adult wild type (WT; n=9), D2KO (n=5), and D1D2KO (n=3) mice. Articular cartilage pathology was scored using the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) histopathology scale for murine OA to determine the severity and extent of disease. Digital X-ray microradiography was used to determine the area and mineral content of subchondral bone immediately beneath the articular cartilage surface. Results: There were no differences in maximum and standardized OA scores, cartilage erosion indices, or articular cartilage cellularity among WT, D2KO, and D1D2KO mice. Subchondral bone area did not differ among genotypes, but mineral content was markedly increased in both D2KO and D1D2KO mice compared to WT. Conclusions: Although adult D2KO mice have normal articular cartilage and no other features of spontaneous joint damage, they exhibit increased subchondral bone mineral content.",25549200,gchappell@toxstrategies.com,,1,,,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,No_Chemical,,Rodent,,,,,,,,,,,No_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,OA put in Other Thyroid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO1,DIO2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Genetic_model_type,D1 knockout|D1D2 double knockout,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Osteoarthritis,reduced tissue T3 availability protects joints from development of OA,

B.","Transport, Metabolism, and Function of Thyroid Hormones in the Developing Mammalian Brain","Ever since the discovery of thyroid hormone deficiency as the primary cause of cretinism in the second half of the 19th century, the crucial role of thyroid hormone (TH) signaling in embryonic brain development has been established. However, the biological understanding of TH function in brain formation is far from complete, despite advances in treating thyroid function deficiency disorders. The pleiotropic nature of TH action makes it difficult to identify and study discrete roles of TH in various aspect of embryogenesis, including neurogenesis and brain maturation. These challenges notwithstanding, enormous progress has been achieved in understanding TH production and its regulation, their conversions and routes of entry into the developing mammalian brain. The endocrine environment has to adjust when an embryo ceases to rely solely on maternal source of hormones as its own thyroid gland develops and starts to produce endogenous TH. A number of mechanisms are in place to secure the proper delivery and action of TH with placenta, blood-brain interface, and choroid plexus as barriers of entry that need to selectively transport and modify these hormones thus controlling their active levels. Additionally, target cells also possess mechanisms to import, modify and bind TH to further fine-tune their action. A complex picture of a tightly regulated network of transport proteins, modifying enzymes, and receptors has emerged from the past studies. TH have been implicated in multiple processes related to brain formation in mammals-neuronal progenitor proliferation, neuronal migration, functional maturation, and survival-with their exact roles changing over developmental time. Given the plethora of effects thyroid hormones exert on various cell types at different developmental periods, the precise spatiotemporal regulation of their action is of crucial importance. In this review we summarize the current knowledge about TH delivery, conversions, and function in the developing mammalian brain. We also discuss their potential role in vertebrate brain evolution and offer future directions for research aimed at elucidating TH signaling in nervous system development.",31001205,gchappell@toxstrategies.com,,1,,,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,No_Chemical,,,,Other_Mammal,,,,,,Other_Group_Species,Vertebrate,,Yes_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Embryo,,,,,,,,Other_Lifestage,development,,,,Mem_Transporters,,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,TH_ADME_PBPK,,,,,,No_NA_thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Secondary,Citation_mining_use,,,,,"TH delivery - distribution proteins and membrane transportersTH conversion - DIO",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,T3,T4,,,,,,,,,Brain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7375811,"Van Herck, S. L., Geysens, S., Delbaere, J., Darras, V. M.",Regulators of thyroid hormone availability and action in embryonic chicken brain development,"Thyroid hormones (THs) are crucial elements in vertebrate brain development. They exert their action mainly through binding of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) to nuclear receptors that directly influence the expression of TH-regulated genes. Intracellular TH action is therefore dependent on both the availability of T3 and its receptors. TH uptake in cells is regulated by specific TH transporters and local activation and inactivation is regulated by deiodinases. This review provides an overview of the general expression pattern of TH transporters, deiodinases and receptors during embryonic chicken brain development and compares it to the situation in mammals. It is clear that THs and their regulators are present in the embryonic brain from the early stages of development, long before the onset of embryonic thyroid gland functioning. The mechanism of TH uptake across the brain barriers during development is only partly understood. At the developing blood-brain-barrier expression of the TH-activating type 2 deiodinase is closely associated with the blood vessels, but contrary to the situation in (adult) mammals no expression of MCT8 or OATP1C1 TH transporters is found at that level in the developing chicken. At the blood-cerebrospinal fluid-barrier co-expression of the TH-inactivating type 3 deiodinase and MCT8 and OATP1C1 is found in birds and mammals. These comparative data show overlapping patterns, pointing to general mechanisms, but also indicate specific interspecies differences that may help to understand species-specific responses to regulator gene knockout/mutation.",23707378,isabel.lea,,1,,,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,No_Chemical,,,,Other_Mammal,,Bird,,,,,,,Yes_LifeStage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Adult,,,Embryo,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mem_Transporters,DIO,,,,,,,,,TR,,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Secondary,Citation_mining_use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO2,DIO3,DIO_mRNA,DIO_protein,,,Expression,,,,,,,,,Thyroid_mRNA,,Brain_mRNA,,,,Other_tissue_mRNA_source,Blood-brain barrier | blood-CSF barrier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Thyroid_protein,,Brain_protein,,,,Other_tissue_protein_source,Blood-brain barrier | blood-CSF barrier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Expression measured but no context provided for gene or protein,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MCT8,,OATP1C1,,,,,,,,MT_mRNA,MT_protein,,,Expression,,,,,,,,,,,Brain_mRNA,,,,Thyroid_mRNA,,,Blood_CSF_mRNA,BBB_mRNA,,,,,,,,Protein_level,,,,,,,,,,,,Brain_protein,,,Blood_CSF_protein,BBB_protein,,,Thyroid_protein,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All-trans-RA (tRA) and other RA receptor (RAR) agonists dramatically (>300-fold) induced Mct8. tRA treatment significantly increased uptake of triiodothyronine and thyroxine (4.1- and 4.3-fold, respectively), which was abolished by a selective Mct8 inhibitor, bromosulfophthalein. Sequence inspection of the Mct8 promoter region and 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR analysis in F9 cells identified 11 transcription start sites and a proximal Sp1 site but no TATA box. tRA significantly enhanced Mct8 promoter activity through a consensus RA-responsive element located 6.6 kilobases upstream of the coding region. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated binding of RAR and retinoid X receptor to the RA response element. The promotion of thyroid hormone uptake through the transcriptional up-regulation of Mct8 by RAR is likely to be important for extraembryonic endoderm development and neural differentiation.

This alteration causes reduced neonatal viability, growth retardation, and central hypothyroidism. Here we examined how these phenotypes are affected by a deficiency in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), which is a major contributor to the transport of the active thyroid hormone, T3, into the cell. MCT8 deficiency eliminated the neonatal lethality of type 3 deiodinase (D3)-deficient mice and significantly ameliorated their growth retardation. Double-mutant newborn mice exhibited similar peripheral thyrotoxicosis and increased brain expression of T3-dependent genes as mice with D3 deficiency only. Later in neonatal life and adulthood, double-mutant mice manifested central and peripheral TH status similar to mice with single MCT8 deficiency, with low serum T4, elevated serum TSH and T3, and decreased T3-dependent gene expression in the hypothalamus. In double-mutant adult mice, both thyroid gland size and the hypothyroidism-induced rise in TSH were greater than those in mice with single D3 deficiency but less than those in mice with MCT8 deficiency alone. Our results demonstrate that the marked phenotypic abnormalities observed in the D3-deficient mouse, including perinatal mortality, growth retardation, and central hypothyroidism in adult animals, require expression of MCT8, confirming the interdependent relationship between the TH transport into cells and the deiodination processes.",27254003,isabel.lea,,1,,,,In_Vivo,,,,,,,No_Chemical,,Rodent,,,,,,,,,,,Yes_LifeStage,,,,,Neonatal,,,,,,,,,Adult,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mem_Transporters,DIO,,,,,,,,,,Other_thyroid_events,,,,,,,Thyroid_MIE_interrogated,No_or_NA_Crosstalk,,Primary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIO3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Genetic_model_type,D3 knockout | D3MCT8 double KO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MCT8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Genetic_model_type,MCT8 KO | D3MCT8 double KO,,,,,,,T3,T4,TSH,,,,TG_weight_size,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other_altered_developoment,Gene_expression,,,,,,,,,
